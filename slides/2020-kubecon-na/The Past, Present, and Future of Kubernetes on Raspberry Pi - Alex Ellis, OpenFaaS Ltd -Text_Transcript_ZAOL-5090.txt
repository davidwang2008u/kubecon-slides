00:00:00 [W] Hello and welcome to my talk on kubenetes on Raspberry Pi. We're going to look at the past the present and the future and I'm going to make this quite personal as we go through my journey, but also hope
00:00:15 [W] here firaon Raspberry Pi cluster
00:00:19 [W] now we start at the beginning.
00:00:21 [W] You know, why would you even do this?
00:00:23 [W] That is the question many people ask.
00:00:26 [W] Where are we today?
00:00:27 [W] How do we get there?
00:00:28 [W] What are the Technologies?
00:00:30 [W] What are the changes that have come in?
00:00:31 [W] I'm going to give you a bill of materials because everyone always seems to ask for that, but I'm actually going to give you more than one.
00:00:40 [W] I'm going to give you four five and you can pick the one that fits your budget.
00:00:45 [W] We're also going to look at what is the future of arm and then go on and I'm going to give
00:00:49 [W] You at that my that we've worked really hard on with some Cool Tools as well.
00:00:56 [W] Then we have a cheat sheet the cheat sheet will give you common questions and answers. Like how do you do storage?
00:01:02 [W] How do you get a public IP address and so forth?
00:01:05 [W] Now this is a one question that you will always get if you pass post something on hacking news or Twitter.
00:01:10 [W] What is a real world use case?
00:01:12 [W] Well, New Mexico, there's a Consortium of three universities and they built out this bit scope 750 node cluster.
00:01:21 [W] Well, perhaps they may not have access to the full expensive cluster and supercomputer.
00:01:31 [W] Maybe they're having to timeshare it by having this pretty costly.
00:01:34 [W] Expensive computers.
00:01:18 [W] So HPC is an interesting one now at the edge.
00:01:21 [W] We see content delivery networks cloudflare wrote two years ago how they've been adopting on 64 for a lot of their workloads now.
00:01:32 [W] Have you ever got a fine or a ticket from parking in the wrong place?
00:01:37 [W] Well Machine learning models running at the edge are doing things like reading plates off cars and then sending you a letter and a fine a few weeks later.
00:01:47 [W] We've also got things like points of sale.
00:01:49 [W] There's a use case from Chick-fil-A where they run five in town looks in their restaurants and they run kubenetes on it.
00:01:58 [W] You could equally well do that on a rack of Raspberry Pi's.
00:02:02 [W] Now we'll also have a look at some managed cloud services are using arm and I think you know, one of the things is we need to get ready for when arm as a laptop device becomes mainstream and we've got this
00:02:16 [W] All day or multi-day battery.
00:02:18 [W] we're going to need binaries at work Raspberry Pi is a good way of getting on that run.
00:02:24 [W] But for you, I think you know the real reason needs to be because you want to and we can justify it.
00:02:29 [W] However we want but at the end of the day this needs to be because you want to you need to be motivated because there are some challenges but it is great to practice on real Hardware. I just love being able to pull an ethernet cable and be able to deploy to real server
00:02:45 [W] 24/7 not worrying about the bill unlike if I leave stuff running on my Amazon account now whether that's a website or a get her bot is up to you. There's a ton of stuff you can run here.
00:02:53 [W] My Demo Rick today is running k3s.
00:02:56 [W] It's a bit scope cluster blade and unlike most Raspberry Pi's is actually net booted over the network and it's running offer an m v. Mme Express storage inside an Intel.
00:03:11 [W] File systems are actually pretty redundant and they're running very fast.
00:03:03 [W] As well as that we've got some redundancy in the control plane and running three Master nodes and Etc d a city of those well, and it's got a public IP address and that's how later on GitHub actions will be able to deploy a new version of my code
00:03:18 [W] house
00:03:15 [W] But I didn't start there. Actually, my first foray was running a Blog at home and it was a ghost blog and that was in 2013.
00:03:24 [W] I was writing about Docker and nodejs and learning about all these kinds of Open Source tools. We but nodejs took about three seconds to run hello world back, then it was slow on and I had to build SQL
00:03:39 [W] 12 hours to get the binary and some of the times it would crash halfway through there were some problems though.
00:03:41 [W] My ISP wasn't that great back in the day and my website might have been in Dhaka weekly and then people are messaging me saying why should block down?
00:03:51 [W] down? That wasn't a good experience performance again. I had to introduce an nginx cash.
00:03:59 [W] On the device just to get a few more requests per second out of the node.js application and then finally Ingress, you know, you can put forward your router but you've now exposed your home address or your location to the world not
00:04:14 [W] And I've got a solution for you for that as well.
00:04:12 [W] Not long afterwards.
00:04:15 [W] Well in 2016.
00:04:16 [W] I've been messing about with Docker and containers and clusters and built this 7 node Raspberry Pi 2 cluster just with little metal standoffs between each of them and I read about this in Linux magazine.
00:04:31 [W] It was published it was available on the High Street and it turned out that people really love this.
00:04:35 [W] They love the idea of running their own cluster now back then we had Bacchus.
00:04:42 [W] home
00:04:44 [W] but things have changed since
00:04:48 [W] we had to build Docker and swarm itself.
00:04:51 [W] And sometimes we didn't have to build go from source.
00:04:54 [W] And this is something that could take hours. And if you had the wrong Colonel option, you had to go back to the start again.
00:05:01 [W] So when Docker released their official binaries and packages in in August 2016, I was over the moon and so was the Raspberry Pi foundation and they wrote this post.
00:05:13 [W] Now we wouldn't be where we are without the work of Lucas kallstrom a teenage boy from Finland.
00:05:21 [W] who at school had this idea.
00:05:24 [W] Even compiling go anymore.
00:05:20 [W] You worked up stream with the go team to get that fixed.
00:05:25 [W] So we do have a debt of gratitude to him and he still involved in the project quite heavily.
00:05:31 [W] And one of the things that I did then was to go and write up a tutorial kubernative Zone raspbian because I wasn't comfortable getting a third party operating system wasn't comfortable having to build a colonel I wanted to get
00:05:46 [W] The Upstream supported Raspberry Pi operating system and lay down kubenetes. And that's where this came about it became so popular that there's been dozens and dozens of blog posts where people have done it themselves using that work
00:06:02 [W] Forgot to present with Scott Hanselman conference.
00:06:01 [W] It was a lot of fun.
00:06:04 [W] But eventually cubed M which is what we were using their started to feel sluggish it started to fail because the timeouts were designed for cloud computers are much more powerful.
00:06:18 [W] And we had this time where I couldn't really run kubermatic on my Raspberry Pi anymore.
00:06:24 [W] The Raspberry Pi 2 was completely ruled out due to a bug and then Darren Shepherd released k3s.
00:06:30 [W] Originally.
00:06:33 [W] It was a something like an 8 million line patch to make it small today.
00:06:39 [W] It is a much less of a patch. In fact, you can install it with coal or with ketchup and you'll have kubenetes in less than 30 seconds even on.
00:06:48 [W] Raspberry Pi now, you couldn't have got anywhere near as fast with cubed member for the resources that it takes for just 500 Meg's not you two gigs per server. And then if you're adding a worker we're looking at 50
00:07:03 [W] Today it is a much less of a patch. In fact, you can install it with coal or with ketchup and you'll have kubenetes in less than 30 seconds.
00:07:04 [W] Even on a Raspberry Pi now. You couldn't have got anywhere near as fast with cubed member for the resources that it takes for just 500 Meg's not you two gigs per server.
00:07:17 [W] And then if you're adding a worker we're looking at 50 Meg's of RAM is so low.
00:07:23 [W] But it's also useful for public cloud and you can run this on Amazon. You can add the cloud controller. You can get storage wall UMES load balancers. You can add all that back in if you want and then the
00:07:38 [W] solo
00:07:40 [W] But it's also useful for public cloud and you can run this on Amazon. You can add the cloud controller. You can get storage wall UMES load balancers. You can add all that back in if you want and then the
00:08:07 [W] we're here is you can actually use SQL or IDs so setup postgres and then that takes over the role of keeping the cluster State and you can actually scale these two hundreds of thousands of clusters
00:08:23 [W] database pretty interesting
00:08:27 [W] now 3 is less than 8 and that's where the name comes from so idea of shrinking down and this is something that really has resonated.
00:08:36 [W] Well with people I was at Darren Shepherds talk and people had their you know, their backs against the wall. It was standing room only it was so many people interested in this but it is still full kubernative.
00:08:48 [W] and is g a so you don't have to worry that it's only for your Raspberry Pi.
00:08:55 [W] Now part of the reason that it is actually so quick.
00:08:57 [W] It's because what Darren stone is he said right instead of picking a network driver is always flannel instead of having accepted Isetta D running.
00:09:08 [W] We're going to use SQL Lite much smaller and instead of installing Docker and getting the right runtime. We're just going to use containerd e and Skip Locker completely.
00:09:17 [W] And that kind of you could think well kubenetes about configuring everything possible and isn't that great you can bring some of those things back in and but actually having somebody said it's okay to have the settings means you can move really
00:09:33 [W] On a bonus point you get volume provisioning you get an ingress controller metrics and Darren's even added a way of installing Helm chart. So it's pretty pretty good package and needs updating all the time.
00:09:46 [W] Now if you think of this journey and the sort of the last few slides of explained the time that we had go binaries was probably about Raspberry Pi 2 timeline darker, then got support for armed and
00:10:02 [W] A lot of work for that as did Stephen and Dieter it hit Prix at the ran the time classics warmers popular.
00:09:58 [W] I spent a lot of time porting the binaries I went to dr.
00:10:02 [W] Khan and gave a talk where I had sensors interacting with the cluster and tekton motion. Then we got those Docker packages in 2016, which were great moving on from there Solomon had two grand vision of Dhaka swarm
00:10:17 [W] Ocean and then Lucas comes into the picture and then kubernative on raspbian.
00:10:19 [W] We have a big gap.
00:10:21 [W] There may be a couple of years and then k3s arrives and it just completely changes the conversation about kubenetes on arm.
00:10:29 [W] We get the 64-bit raspbian OS that's still in beta as I speak, but I've been to 20 is available as well.
00:10:38 [W] Okay, so by default we're running 32-bit operating system for compatibility backwards, but this 64-bit is where the future is.
00:10:48 [W] Now when it comes to building your own I want to think about what you know, what is your budget? And what are you willing to spend and what you want to do with it?
00:10:59 [W] If you're looking to use spare parts, it could cost you nothing.
00:11:03 [W] You might already have this stuff.
00:11:05 [W] This was the way I entered into it copper standoffs Raspberry Pi 3 some SD cards and you can use a multi charger for powering these if you get a 60 watt if you want to netboot though,
00:11:20 [W] The B3 plus I have the older bof got 25 of them, and I can't netboot them and it's annoying.
00:11:24 [W] If you're building on a budget, this is where most of you are expect you want to start here.
00:11:30 [W] You only need one Raspberry Pi to run k3s.
00:11:33 [W] You don't need 10.
00:11:36 [W] Maybe pick a number like 4 and you can either buy the 2gig model.
00:11:40 [W] I'm using it for my demo am using four of them.
00:11:43 [W] Or you can go up to eight gigs.
00:11:46 [W] I mean k3s doesn't need a lot of resources that you just need to think about what you want to run but you will need official power supplies one each. You can't use a multi charger.
00:11:57 [W] I've been there I've done that.
00:11:59 [W] It doesn't have enough power. It will Brown out and you must add fans.
00:12:04 [W] Okay case like this.
00:12:05 [W] We'll give you that.
00:12:08 [W] As an upgrade though. You can boot from it an SSD in a PC and is will be so fast. Now cheering pie you may have heard of this.
00:12:18 [W] They sent me one to play with it's over here.
00:12:21 [W] It's pretty expensive.
00:12:21 [W] But what I like about it is one cable for power and one cable for ethernet and that's that you then program computer modules and they're like mini Raspberry Pi is but without any ports
00:12:35 [W] plug them in boot up and you're done.
00:12:37 [W] Now the CM for is arriving soon.
00:12:40 [W] He's and it's going to be based.
00:12:31 [W] It's going to have ssds in it.
00:12:34 [W] It will be ridiculous the expensive but also very fast but Best in Class and this is what I have is to go and get an edge rack something that you can mount in your garage.
00:12:46 [W] You can put a UPC on it. You can Boot It Off the network UPS rather.
00:12:52 [W] You can pair it with a proper 12 to 24 volt power.
00:12:56 [W] You could even go install this in a shop somewhere.
00:12:59 [W] Or in off-site and it's good run your workloads manage it remotely and this is where industrial Raspberry Pi thing is really going to take off.
00:13:09 [W] So you for those last five years of building these clusters and tinkering and writing blog posts. I noticed certain number of problems and it was always the same sort of thing.
00:13:23 [W] How do I deploy code?
00:13:25 [W] It's so confusing to right? Yeah mlops need a network connection.
00:13:29 [W] I don't know what software is available for arm and I spend half my time installing things.
00:13:34 [W] things. I don't work.
00:13:35 [W] Well, you can go and read this blog post and it shows you all of those things.
00:13:40 [W] I create some stuff that maybe we'll get you inspired. But to sum up these are four of the projects that came out about Journey. The first is open fast and open fires.
00:13:52 [W] If you have a website hook receiver or blog if you want to write a microservice in Java python go you name it. It can get you there very quickly k3s can be installed with curl but also
00:13:52 [W] Catch up and so if you liked doc a swarm where it's in it on one node, and then join on another one with a token ketchup brings that back.
00:13:48 [W] I'm going to show you the syntax in let's allows you to get a public IP address for load balancer.
00:13:55 [W] That's something that you just can't get normally in a cloud. When if you deploy a service it normally has a load balancer the cloud will provision a hardware software load balancer hook up an IP address for you. So if you traffic you can't do that.
00:14:09 [W] At home you can now if you install inlets and there's an operator that works with kubernative. And then the last thing is arcade it will tell you if a chart is compatible or not and we
00:14:24 [W] There there are things like Castillo, which is currently not available for us brick pie, but maybe in the future things like open far's things like Mineo which are and that you can just go in and stall.
00:14:36 [W] Now I want to show you a demo if putting all of this together and this is for I'm not going to say it's a Blog.
00:14:43 [W] it's more like a CMS because there's probably not much Point running a Blog on a Raspberry Pi maybe a bit overpowered for that.
00:14:49 [W] You can use a CDN, but what if you want to get a better experience or what if you want to run a Blog of blocks what if you want to run a SAS for a thousand customers, maybe you could think about it like this.
00:15:04 [W] We have an admin panel is called add post and that's a function.
00:15:07 [W] We write a bit of markdown and tell it what the name is.
00:15:11 [W] We then do a git commit and hands are off at that point next a GitHub action in your git repo will run Hugo.
00:15:21 [W] Take them up down output. 'html put it in a Docker file and then deploy it to your cluster as the blog function and we can have all of that in a loop where we don't have to get involved
00:15:36 [W] Is you write your code in a web page hit commits password-protected and then you get it published on your blog at static content.
00:15:44 [W] Well, that's what we're going to do.
00:15:45 [W] So the first thing is I took my Raspberry Pi's and Iran ketchup install.
00:15:52 [W] I put the IP address and the user I then went to the next one and I needed to join and I gave it the server's IP address and then I had a cluster and it just took a few minutes.
00:16:05 [W] The next thing I did is I use the arcade tool and whilst you can go off to brew apt-get or troll the internet to get Cube cut off.
00:16:15 [W] This is a really easy way to getting it so I ran Cube cut will get okayed get sorry up K get Cube cut all get ketchup get fancy light and run. These commands are then installed open fast, and we've each of these apps
00:16:30 [W] Parameters and then I installed an inquest controller and certain manager right because I want some way of getting TLS on there because I want this to be secure and mapping that to my domain.
00:16:32 [W] Now open files is quite simple to get started with but it's also really powerful. If you want to you can just run faster your line new and put Python 3.
00:16:44 [W] So you sharp go PHP pick a language the name of your functions a strike payment and then when you run faster you lie up it will deploy to your instance by building an image pushing in a registry and then
00:16:59 [W] Stuff and so you can kind of see on this picture the ways to interact a by CLI UI and the rest API.
00:16:59 [W] We also have metrics built into this. So Prometheus will tell you if you have any 500s if the API is getting called a lot because of popular blog then it will get Scaled up for you.
00:17:11 [W] And also if you have something I don't know.
00:17:15 [W] Let's say the publisher of the blog took three seconds. We can run that asynchronously.
00:17:19 [W] in the background using thats
00:17:23 [W] Okay, and this is something that you can install the total amount of RAM is less than 300 Max and most of that is Prometheus and Prometheus is a Time series database to collect your metrics.
00:17:36 [W] This is how things look then for our demo today.
00:17:42 [W] At the bottom left, we've got the two functions in the boxes and in the circles, they're attached to our Gateway.
00:17:49 [W] I gateways access through an Ingress controller as a certificate from let's encrypt pretty standard, but that's normally where things end because we don't have any way of getting internet in maybe you open a p*** your firewall if your ISP
00:18:04 [W] But in my example install this inlets operator it created a tunnel.
00:18:03 [W] the tunnel was created on an easy to VM. And then when my GitHub action talks to that VM. So IP address all my user comes and tries to get to the blog it gets tunneled back into my network,
00:18:18 [W] sense
00:18:07 [W] So let's go and try this demo out.
00:18:12 [W] First of all, this is the blog and you can see that this is running on.
00:18:27 [W] This is running on the public internet is got a TLS certificate.
00:18:34 [W] And it's showing as valid if I go into my cluster and I get my services in the cube system namespace will see that the external IP addresses showing here
00:18:49 [W] And it's showing as valid if I go into my cluster and I get my services in the cube system namespace.
00:18:56 [W] We'll see that the external IP addresses showing here too. And then I have an English record for this.
00:19:08 [W] And we can see that keep con catch up Dev. Okay.
00:19:13 [W] The last post is this one from the community meeting and I just took the notes if you attended it and here is my function where I can basically come in and and write a post and what I thought is we could just
00:19:28 [W] Took the notes if you attended it, and here is my function where I can basically come in and write a post and what I thought is we could just take a bit of the ketchup readme file.
00:19:43 [W] And enter it here.
00:19:49 [W] I'm going to give this a title.
00:19:54 [W] And you can see that I've entered some markdown.
00:19:56 [W] I mean, this is not a product.
00:19:58 [W] It's just an example. And what I want to do is show you that now when I hit commit
00:20:05 [W] Something's happening in the background my Raspberry Pi is doing a push to the GitHub repo.
00:20:13 [W] And we'll be able to see a new commit.
00:20:17 [W] Just here 12 seconds ago.
00:20:19 [W] We can go into it and we can see what it's put in place and it's generated a header for us also generated a file name but a GitHub action to start to run.
00:20:34 [W] And this GitHub action, he's going to clone the repo is then going to use the open Vice Hugo template to build that HTML.
00:20:46 [W] In fact at this point in time, the image is almost ready to be pushed to the docker Hub. We're now looking into the open first gateway over the inlets tunnel.
00:20:57 [W] This is going to be pushed remotely and then we'll see the new version of the blog up here with that post.
00:21:03 [W] to start to run
00:21:06 [W] and this GitHub action is going to clone the repo is then going to use the open-faced Hugo template to build that HTML.
00:21:19 [W] In fact at this point in time, the image is almost ready to be pushed to the docker Hub. We're now looking into the open first gateway over the inlets tunnel.
00:21:29 [W] This is going to be pushed remotely and then we'll see the new version of the blog up here with that post.
00:21:43 [W] Right.
00:21:44 [W] Let's try it out.
00:21:46 [W] So we need to go to the log function.
00:21:50 [W] And there we are.
00:21:51 [W] It's that I need that probably was less than a minute in total.
00:21:56 [W] There's several things. We can optimize along the way we could make a better markdown editor, you know, the sky is the limit there.
00:22:07 [W] If we have a look at the events.
00:22:12 [W] The open files - namespace will see that the probe likeness probe. Stop working on the old container.
00:22:19 [W] Then you want was pulled in. We can actually see the get Char here that was used for the image and the tag and it's a multi Arch image built on the cloud deployed on a cluster now.
00:22:31 [W] We also want to show you that we can get we can get the top pods across the cluster and see what
00:22:39 [W] Also say using so we've got CPU usage.
00:22:43 [W] Prometheus is actually one of the busier things that we've got here. The blog is basically almost at idle and then we can look at the memory consumption.
00:22:53 [W] And there's a bunch of things that come with k3s that are running in the background, but overall, we're not really using a lot of resources.
00:23:00 [W] We can also run top node, and we getting this data because k3s comes with the metric server built in.
00:23:09 [W] We can also run top node, and we getting this data because k3s comes with the metric server built in.
00:23:17 [W] And then you ever want that might be interesting is is to get the nodes and here we see that 3 of running a city as Masters and one is an agent if one of these was to disappear.
00:23:32 [W] Be able to tolerate that failure and carry on.
00:23:40 [W] So that's a taste of what you can do with your own cluster. But now when we look towards the future, I think managed cloud has got a lot to do with this journey Amazon produced AWS produced a graviton
00:23:56 [W] I think managed cloud has got a lot to do with this journey Amazon produced AWS produced a graviton chip several years ago.
00:24:01 [W] They've now introduced a new chip called gravity and to which is on compatible. You see a little picture of it there.
00:24:10 [W] And then not only can you get the whole machine as bare metal, but you can get individual slices of it as instances with as little as one call or or two gigs of RAM.
00:24:24 [W] You can then go and use this with their managed services like RDS and elasticache save money.
00:24:30 [W] In fact, there's a user here.
00:24:33 [W] This tweet was I think it was from yesterday and Valentino.
00:24:36 [W] You can show you a graph here of how much that is actually costing him per hit inside his company.
00:24:44 [W] Now if you need real control and you want very big service pack, it also known as equinix metal have great options here and their data center link is you know in the regions of
00:24:59 [W] Gigabytes, it's really really fast.
00:25:02 [W] You're only going to pay between half a dollar and a dollar per hour for these so it might work out expensive in the long run but to try it out. It's pretty cheap and they've done a lot for the ecosystem.
00:25:13 [W] So they've worked with vendors like ampere and they're going to be bringing this new ultramax a hundred and twenty-eight course.
00:25:19 [W] Imagine this H top in the background where you can't see what processes you're running in your terminal because you've got too many calls and it's a good problem to have
00:25:28 [W] to have
00:25:31 [W] And it wouldn't be right to do a talk on arm without talking about Apple.
00:25:36 [W] We've all heard of Apple silicon.
00:25:39 [W] We might even have had some product announcements by the time you hear this talk.
00:25:41 [W] Apple silicon is not an arm chip.
00:25:45 [W] At least that's what they're saying.
00:25:47 [W] It is an 64 compatible.
00:25:50 [W] It's the same instruction set in the same way that an Intel and AMD chip a largely compatible. Now this has potential to give us more
00:26:00 [W] Today battery and a laptop imagine that and why this is Apple silicon and not an arm chip is because I've had so much more.
00:26:09 [W] I mean they have a machine learning acceleration.
00:26:12 [W] They've got great power management.
00:26:13 [W] They've got secure enclaves to store secrets and and state and a bunch of other stuff.
00:26:18 [W] So keep an eye on this.
00:26:21 [W] Now you may have seen this error.
00:26:24 [W] so first set each of these Raspberry Pi's, unfortunately runs a different version of armed and they're not all compatible or they are in some ways and the latest is the for its 64-bit
00:26:35 [W] The latest is the for its 64-bit arm.
00:26:24 [W] And if you're building go is unfortunately very easy to cross compile.
00:26:30 [W] So in the old days you might have just built that binary on an 64 machine for your arm users, but you can actually build it on your PC or on a Mac or whatever you want and cross compile. And this is how you put the arguments
00:26:45 [W] Now the tricky thing is that nobody not everyone will call it an 64.
00:26:51 [W] Some people will call it that some will call it a arch 64 some people call this arm V7 some people call it on HF and whilst there are similarities and there are nuances it would be great if we could standardize and we just
00:27:07 [W] so beware
00:27:10 [W] Dr. However, it has done a huge amount of work in a space and then you build X tool means that you can take an existing dockerfile.
00:27:18 [W] It's a multi-stage build here specify the bill Plante form and a Target platform and they can be different if you want and then through some trickery and some emulation top there.
00:27:29 [W] there. I've built for a PC Raspberry Pi 32-bit OS and a 64-bit OS and there's not much more you have to do.
00:27:39 [W] So quick cheat sheet Cube admins to Hungry its timing out.
00:27:43 [W] You want more resources use k3s.
00:27:46 [W] Your SD cards are unreliable.
00:27:48 [W] Look at the cheering pie.
00:27:51 [W] Maybe use it emmc or netboot.
00:27:55 [W] I have a workshop for that come and speak to me.
00:27:57 [W] I can give you access to it.
00:27:59 [W] And that's what I've used for my cluster.
00:28:02 [W] You don't have a load balancer.
00:28:04 [W] Okay. Well if you need a public IP address you
00:28:08 [W] unless operator
00:28:10 [W] It's a steep learning curve.
00:28:11 [W] I know if you get it.
00:28:13 [W] I've been through it as well catch up could help you use the install and join command.
00:28:18 [W] That's all you need.
00:28:19 [W] It's then back to normal kubenetes discovering apps use arcade up install. It will tell you if it's going to work or not.
00:28:28 [W] Maybe build it build ax maybe download it manually from the releases page and there is a story for storage.
00:28:35 [W] Lots of people want this you can use an NFS provisioner that uses your network file system in Linux.
00:28:41 [W] You can use local path provisioner that uses the storage on the Node from k3s and soon the cncf Rancher project that Rancher donated Longhorn should have arm 64 support is on their road map and that gives
00:28:56 [W] volumes in software
00:28:50 [W] Now just to wrap up.
00:28:52 [W] Raspberry Pi non are widely used for real work.
00:28:56 [W] I hope that I've got that point across to you.
00:28:59 [W] You can build your own private cloud and you do not have to worry about leaving it on like you do with your Amazon account.
00:29:06 [W] It is not going to cost you anywhere near what it would cost to run in eks cluster, but you are going to have to become an advocate if you want to spend some time here.
00:29:16 [W] You're going to find yourself discovering gaps other people didn't know about raising GitHub issues portworx.
00:29:22 [W] Request sporting software over even going and working with package maintainers and Helm charts, so it's not for everyone but you can have a lot of fun while you're at it and there's a great Community around this and a ton of Interest.
00:29:38 [W] So look out for Apple silicon.
00:29:40 [W] Hmm.
00:29:41 [W] Look out for mainstream arm laptops, and I don't mean one or two, but everybody's using them.
00:29:48 [W] I think this is a trend we're going to see the CM for with that super fast PCI slot. We can just stick a an SSD straight into there that is going to be ridiculously fast.
00:29:59 [W] Keep an eye out for all of these Trends and if there's any way that I can be of help for free to get in touch.
00:30:06 [W] Is to have Intel machines to fall back on if you're running into trouble and I do really hope that you have fun with this.
00:30:11 [W] So thank you for listening.
00:30:14 [W] You can get hold of me on Twitter down below or you can send me an e-mail. I'll be glad to hear from you.
00:30:21 [W] K3s is available here my Twitter account. And if you want to join the openfaas community in talk about those tools or contribute to them.
00:30:30 [W] You're more than welcome to welcome to as well.
00:30:33 [W] We may have run out of time for QA.
00:30:36 [W] However, I'll make myself available whether that's some slack or Twitter will know soon closer to the time where that is.
00:30:43 [W] All right.
00:30:44 [W] Thank you so much.
