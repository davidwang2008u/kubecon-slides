00:00:00 [W] Hello, everybody. Welcome to the introduction to Sig cluster lifecycle.
00:00:05 [W] My name is Justin Santa Barbara.
00:00:07 [W] I am one of these Sig cluster lifecycle co-leads.
00:00:09 [W] Lumiere and myself are going to be giving this presentation together, but we are representing the work of a great many people within the sake.
00:00:16 [W] Hello.
00:00:17 [W] My name is suvorov.
00:00:19 [W] I'm a sequence alive. Say Koko lead software engineer at VMware has open source program office and my GitHub handle is nearly 23.
00:00:30 [W] So here is what we are going to talk about today.
00:00:32 [W] We are going to explain what is sequenced life cycle.
00:00:36 [W] What is the mission a philosophy of the special interest group?
00:00:39 [W] Also we are going to cover the stack of Sue projects that we maintain in particular.
00:00:44 [W] We're going to highlight three of them.
00:00:46 [W] These are questions API componentconfig and image Builder and finally we're going to show you how you can get involved into contributing to the special interest group.
00:00:58 [W] What is Seacoast life cycle?
00:01:02 [W] In kubernative took a special interest groups also known as 6 and sequels to life cycle is one of those all the six also have Charter documents and the charter document is something that defines what are the goals and
00:01:18 [W] SQL select Cycles objective is to simplify the creation configuration upgrade downgrade and teardown of kubernative coasters and their components.
00:01:17 [W] Also special interest group. You also have a vision to develop the tooling necessary to build a highly automated method called America called here means imagine something that is a cover. It is coaster that can be deployed on any
00:01:32 [W] We want to avoid the pitfalls of the past because you had some unsuccessful experiments in the past.
00:01:27 [W] Everything should be declarative. API driven kade's like deployment type of style and managing. These questions should be as easy as managing the kubernative subjects like pots.
00:01:42 [W] It's a familiar pattern to everyone what to make the 80% use case simple and 20% use case possible always consider a simple configuration available to everyone but there has to be this
00:01:53 [W] Advanced configuration that is still possible to the rest of the users.
00:01:52 [W] We also want to commoditize or standardized Kate's coaster deployments.
00:01:58 [W] So if somebody's looking at your quest, sir, eventually, they're going to know that okay. This is following a standardized way a standardized pattern for close to deployment.
00:02:12 [W] So on this slide, we have a diagram of the current stack of tools that we are working on at the bottom we have had cdms EDM is potentially a manager of its requesters a COI and a library that is working progress
00:02:27 [W] high-level tools
00:02:29 [W] on top we have q beta M Cube ADM is a coaster bootstrapper as or people should know already a question of those is a project where we are working on standardizing the way others are deployed in the
00:02:44 [W] They're managed as a lifecycle. Look how do you upgrade them how to downgrade them?
00:02:43 [W] Because they're a pi or of people should be familiar Crystal Pious.
00:02:47 [W] Well, this is a project where you can create courses using a declarative model is very similar to the kubernative declarative patterns.
00:02:56 [W] So if you combine these two these tools you can potentially produce artifacts that you can then feed to image Builder and image Builder can create like a virtual machine.
00:03:08 [W] It's for you and the virtual machine image can then be fed to the casa provisioner, which is a layer on top the cost of provisional can create you a question sir. That uses this virtual machine image and finally on the
00:03:23 [W] componentconfig componentconfig Saadia is that we can configure all these components on the right side with declarative API there is very similar to the kubernative CPI and in fact it
00:03:36 [W] Guy that is very similar to the kubernative CPI. And in fact, it uses the same machinery.
00:03:37 [W] As a group we are also trying to follow a particular philosophy and that is arguably the Unix philosophy.
00:03:44 [W] We want to make each program do one thing and do it very, well the boundaries between the separate projects should be clear and the should not be ideally that much overlap every computing.
00:04:00 [W] Think and do it very well the boundaries between the separate projects should be clear and there should not be ideally that much overlap every Computing infrastructure project that initially meets one need well.
00:04:19 [W] That initially meets one needs. Well, we were eventually expanding scope to only meet several needs poorly.
00:04:28 [W] This is something that we have to avoid.
00:04:30 [W] We also expect the output of every program to become the input of another program and combining all the tools that we have. We want to create this Voltron like software.
00:04:45 [W] On this slide, you can see upsell dough Voltron example.
00:04:48 [W] It's a immutable note update type of scenario.
00:04:52 [W] So the left side we have a CI at triggers are rebuilt of artifacts notifies an operator to update customer effects that the potentially consumed by the questor API the Costa Rica
00:05:07 [W] Rolling update then a booster a provider which in this case is Cube ATM to trigger the new nodes to join the coaster.
00:05:18 [W] During keep Kane you 2020. We created a survey to let our users get back to us with some feedback.
00:05:24 [W] The main takeaway is our users are still struggling to keep up with the release Cadence of kubernative. Currently. There is a proposal to shift to a three releases per year process instead of for this seems to be
00:05:39 [W] Both option by a lot of users to upgrade process can be difficult due to Korea Pi changes and deprecations removals.
00:05:39 [W] Basically, we saw a number of comments about this as direct responses in the survey itself Ubuntu as an operating system for VMS Docker as a container runtime using Docker shim in this case
00:05:54 [W] Service self Ubuntu other operating system for VMS Docker as a container runtime using Docker. She made this case and Calico as the cni-genie.
00:06:19 [W] In this section, we would like to highlight some projects that we are currently working on.
00:06:25 [W] Okay, I'm going to highlight another one of our projects the cluster API cluster API is building a declarative kubernative style API for creation and management of clusters.
00:06:37 [W] It also manages some of the infrastructure that is cluster scoped things like networks or I am policy from your cloud provider.
00:06:45 [W] It's focused around a declarative specification of the machines that become the nodes of the cluster.
00:06:54 [W] Some important things to understand this is different from the kubernative cloudbees Vidor, which provides workloads Cloud resources, like volumes and load balancers. This is provisioning similar infrastructure, but for the cluster itself
00:07:09 [W] One of the important design decisions was that the specification of a machine is immutable but it's interesting in that cluster API still provides the ability to upgrade the cluster.
00:07:24 [W] You may be asking yourself.
00:07:24 [W] How is this possible?
00:07:26 [W] How can the machine be immutable yet?
00:07:29 [W] The cluster can be upgraded and therefore be mutable and the answer is that we follow a similar pattern as kubenetes does we don't just want to use kubernative cri-o.
00:07:39 [W] Dee's we want to follow the kubernative zpi design patterns and in kubernative is there is indeed a similar design pattern pods are immutable but pods are wrapped by replica sets which runs a number of them a replica set remains
00:07:54 [W] Be immutable yet. The cluster can be upgraded and therefore be mutable and the answer is that we follow a similar pattern as kubernative does we don't just want to use kubernative CR DS.
00:08:05 [W] We want to follow the kubernative API design patterns.
00:08:08 [W] And in kubernative is there is indeed a similar design pattern pods are immutable but pods are wrapped by replica sets which runs a number of them a replica set remains immutable but a deployment creates
00:08:22 [W] ability over those replicas sets.
00:08:25 [W] It is able to create a new replica set and scales down the old one and scales up the new one.
00:08:30 [W] So we use exactly the same pattern and cluster API.
00:08:34 [W] I'm machine like a pod is immutable machine has a number of replicas in a machine set like a replica set and a machine set is still immutable, but a machine deployment can create a new machine
00:09:02 [W] Ball but a deployment creates mutability over those replicas sets.
00:09:07 [W] It is able to create a new replica set and scales down the old one and scales up the new one.
00:09:13 [W] So we use exactly the same pattern and cluster API a machine like a pod is immutable a machine has a number of replicas in a machine set like a replica set and a machine set is still immutable.
00:09:51 [W] On the old machine set and scale up the new one a machine deployment is just like a deployment and that's how we can achieve mutability at the machine deployment level.
00:10:02 [W] The machine is the same ci/cd whether this is on AWS or gcp or VMware and there's an analogy here to storage class has in kubenetes.
00:10:12 [W] There is similarly a machine class machine classes at kubenetes object that describes attributes of the machine that are specific to that cloud provider just as
00:10:21 [W] a storage class describes attributes that are specific to a particular storage back-end.
00:10:27 [W] Cluster API is a newer API and we've actually developed our thinking around this design pattern over time machine class objects are actually typed objects.
00:10:37 [W] It has a different kind on AWS than on gcp AWS is an AWS machine. Template.
00:10:45 [W] GCE is a GCE machine template this allows for the fields of a machine class object to the to be specific to the cloud or infrastructure provider.
00:10:55 [W] And that allows us to get richer type checking and validation then we do in the storage class where a storage class has the same kind across all the storage back ends.
00:11:05 [W] So not only re use but also evolution of the kubernative design patterns.
00:11:14 [W] So let's talk a little bit about the cluster API roadmap cluster API is still in Alpha.
00:11:20 [W] In goal is to get it into widespread real world use and continue to get feedback on whether our expectations match how this thing is used in production more automation also helps with this goal both automation of testing and of the project
00:11:35 [W] But the next couple of Alphas are going to focus on some of those blockers robustness of the control plane a few features like Auto scaling and spot instances some improvements to the primary user facing tool called cluster CTL and in the alpha after
00:11:37 [W] Nodes extensibility of load balancing using the latest features from some of the other Sig sub projects in order to get to Beta the really big thing. We need is better documentation, which goes hand-in-hand with more feedback from Real World users like you
00:11:51 [W] Also getting an integrated into some of those higher level tools. So for example cops is planning to support cluster API initially for the nodes and getting the existing kubernative Z 2E tests using cluster API on gcp and on AWS
00:12:06 [W] To learn more about the question API. You can join a deep dive session we have about it here at keep calm and a 2020. It's going to be presented by category by nginx Carlos panopto on Friday, November 20th.
00:12:22 [W] A lot of project that we wish to highlight this componentconfig componentconfig is a Cooperative style API for configuring components and componentconfig is trying to solve some problems.
00:12:35 [W] The first one is that the core kubernetes components are not consistent in how they are configured.
00:12:42 [W] They use a lot of flags and oftentimes the flags across the different components that do exactly the same thing have different names the solution.
00:12:52 [W] Notice that the core components should implement componentconfig.
00:12:55 [W] And in fact, most of the core components have already started doing that. Another problem is that it's pretty hard to write a Kate's like componentconfig Clarity of coffee.
00:13:08 [W] So adding a couple coffee itself is not that easy.
00:13:12 [W] So the solution for that is that we should Factor common Logic for component related code in the repository designated for that. That is componentconfig.
00:13:22 [W] Existing components should be retrofitted to use the same talk it.
00:13:24 [W] Componentconfig gives us a lot of benefits. It has maintainability.
00:13:29 [W] So when a component has a flag set that grows over 50 flags configuration becomes painful upgradability.
00:13:37 [W] So for upgrades version configuration is arguably easier to manage them Flags since flags are over shan't programmability configuration expressed as Json in the objects and also for consistent
00:13:52 [W] I'll also consistent manipulation templating patching introspection and also possibility many types of config simply cannot be expressed as key-value pairs.
00:13:43 [W] And finally, it's also declarative open API formation can be exposed using componentconfig and use for generating documentation for your config to learn more about componentconfig.
00:13:57 [W] You can watch the stock that Lucas kallstrom gave the previous Cube call and in this talk, you can actually see some of the details implementation details around how we are actually implementing componentconfig in existing
00:14:12 [W] Or how do we want future components to implement it?
00:14:19 [W] In kubernative we have a working group that is called components standards.
00:14:23 [W] It's a combined effort between sequence alive cycle and seek API Machinery trying to tackle some of these problems around componentconfig to get engaged of fight more about it.
00:14:37 [W] You can follow these links.
00:14:44 [W] Another project that we wish to highlight this image Builder image Builder is essentially a tool for building virtual machine images not to be confused with containerd images.
00:14:53 [W] It includes a simple and Packers scripts which are well supported by VMware Microsoft and other companies for creating consider API machine images the current list of supported operating systems include Ubuntu sent West 307 Photon Amazon Linux
00:15:08 [W] that we wish to highlight this image Builder image Builder is essentially a tool for building virtual machine images not to be confused with containerd images it includes ansible and Packers scripts which are well supported by VMware Microsoft and other companies for creating consider
00:15:39 [W] What is coming soon image Builder is targeting VMware AWS are jerk.
00:15:44 [W] Um, oh and digital ocean as providers of infrastructure.
00:15:48 [W] The project has also started working on a conforming test Suite which uses geoss which is a double bass 7 Speculator knative to for validating server's configuration.
00:15:59 [W] The repository of the project also includes some other tools such as cube deploy, which is still used by cops for creating images for AWS.
00:16:09 [W] Config ATM, which is a tool for generating coordinate and Bash for configuration of virtual machine images.
00:16:19 [W] Here are some of the goals of the image Builder project provide a consistent tooling for all approaches for building images so that we can create more standardized the usable Intel small images make it easier for Downstream consumers to customize their
00:16:34 [W] Positions up-to-date testing of images for verify conformance using tools like inspect and geoss release of images for different quote operating system combinations with regular updates.
00:16:49 [W] Image Builder is a fairly new project. So we have a big road map for it.
00:16:53 [W] The COI still Alphas. One of the goals is to get it to beater PR testing for Builds on AWS.
00:17:00 [W] GC p and Q Mo are planned Azure is already running on PR submits.
00:17:06 [W] What cars supporting Windows support are also on the roadmap conformance testing and testing sweets stress testing for log rotation and immutability submissions through the Cooperative test.
00:17:19 [W] Which is the tool we use to monitor end-to-end tests and finally image publishing signing in release, which is similar to away. The official kubernative containers are promoted today.
00:17:34 [W] To learn more about image Builder. You can see our deep dive session here and keep calm and a 2020 is going to be on Thursday November 19th presented by Moshe Melman and to char a girl. Wow.
00:17:49 [W] I wanted to talk a little bit about how you can get involved.
00:17:53 [W] Curse supporting Windows support are also on the roadmap conformance testing and testing sweets stress testing for log rotation and immutability submissions for the Co-operative test. Grid, which is the tool we use to Monitor
00:20:04 [W] But otherwise the projects are in beta and Alpha or even pre Alpha. So we need your help and I'd suggest this is also an opportunity. Sometimes as a kubernative contributor. It can feel like
00:20:19 [W] One has either already been done or there are ten existing issue stating why you can't do it that is very much not the case in Sig cluster life cycle.
00:20:27 [W] There is a lot of work still to do that work is very concrete and we are very oriented around encouraging contributors.
00:20:37 [W] Specifically we have some onboarding documentation, which is a great place to start along with our community page many of the sub projects are excellent to triaging issues.
00:20:48 [W] They label issues with good first issue or help wanted to try to steer you to issues that don't require the in-depth knowledge that you'll likely gain over time. A great way to get involved is with documentation or even just trying out different things and Reporting any issues you
00:21:03 [W] There are a number of zoo meetings.
00:21:03 [W] There's an overall Sig cluster life cycle. We meeting bi-weekly and many of the sub projects have their own bi-weekly meetings as well.
00:21:11 [W] So, please attend ask questions introduce yourself introduce yourself on slack.
00:21:17 [W] There's a very active slack Channel where you can find people at all hours of the day and night if you're not yet a kubernative contributor. I encourage you to attend the new contributor sessions that are run by C contributor experience.
00:21:31 [W] In general the kubernative is community philosophy is that you earn your place at the table by chopping wood and carrying water by taking on the tasks that need to be done.
00:21:39 [W] So everyone is expected to get involved and the flip side of that is that you are there for welcome and encouraged to get involved.
00:21:53 [W] We have reached the end of the presentation.
00:21:55 [W] Thank you very much for your time. And now we can have a Q&A session.
00:22:02 [W] Hello everybody.
00:22:03 [W] My name is Justin Santa Barbara.
00:22:05 [W] Thank you for watching Lumiere. I think is unable to join us.
00:22:10 [W] It is very labor.
00:22:11 [W] He is he sends his apologies if you want to see him and talk to him.
00:22:16 [W] He attends the bi-weekly meetings on a regular basis.
00:22:20 [W] We don't currently have any QA questions.
00:22:24 [W] Please do feel free to add any questions. You may have into the box where your box might be I do.
00:22:29 [W] Anyway, but if we don't get questions, we always you don't need to use the full time.
00:22:26 [W] So whatever people want to do.
00:22:29 [W] It is your time.
00:22:29 [W] I will be available in the slack channel for this I guess session which is to - koukin - maintainer in the cncf slack and
00:22:44 [W] Slack is also I guess there's a my cap webcast.
00:22:36 [W] Another slack is also the Sig cluster life cycle in the kubernative slack.
00:22:41 [W] And so those are those are great places to communicate for the next half hour or so and then in general the circleci bicycle is great and all the suffragettes also have also have the their own their own mess like handles as well.
00:22:56 [W] I have a question, which is wonderful.
00:22:56 [W] Thank you. Rohit asks any thoughts on making kubeedge e-m work programmatically ieave. I apis yeah, I mean, I think that's a really great idea.
00:23:06 [W] I know that kubeedge am has done a lot of work in this space around things like faces.
00:23:14 [W] It's not trivial to do so, and so I think it's it's a difficult.
00:23:22 [W] Balance to strike between you know, having a really nice intuitive user experience and exposing everything in a very modular way and also being able to do that as things advance, but the I assume
00:23:37 [W] because you would like to use kubeedge am in a larger tool and sort of as we've outlined that is very much the goal of all the Sig cluster lifecycle whole building block building block projects kubeedge am is intended as a building block so
00:23:49 [W] Use Kuma TM directly, but if you wanted to build your own community, so you should be comfortable using kubeedge EMH would work well for you as well.
00:23:50 [W] I think a lot of people are using it today.
00:23:53 [W] I think the primary way they interact with it is via the command line litmuschaos is probably a better person to answer some of the more detailed questions about other ways to interact with it.
00:24:05 [W] it. So I think if if you want to follow up more on that either attends the
00:24:13 [W] Sig cluster lifecycle meeting or the probably better one to attend is the kubeedge DM meeting for people that don't know on the GitHub kubernative Community repo.
00:24:27 [W] They're all the cigs in communities have sort of all their subjects listed and there.
00:24:32 [W] Ah, okay. I have all this effort is listed and the there times that they meet and it sounds like I've received a car fire.
00:24:43 [W] Question from from a question from a ritzy who points out that there is a kubeedge DM operator Rohit it is I wish we had full two-way communication here.
00:24:52 [W] That is why you should join the regular Zoom meetings.
00:24:55 [W] But Fabricio says we FYI we are discussing the kubeedge DM operator.
00:25:01 [W] so you maybe talk about the kubeedge DM operator, but that is certainly relevant.
00:25:07 [W] Thank you for the prom pretty I don't again.
00:25:10 [W] I don't know.
00:25:10 [W] They feel comfortable speaking to that and I would I would direct you to the the by weekly bi-weekly meeting my new weekly. I'm just scrolling through the the scrolling through the sequester lifecycle list myself.
00:25:22 [W] It looks like they meet bi-weekly Wednesdays at 9:00 a.m.
00:25:26 [W] Pacific is the kubeedge DM meeting slot. So I think that would be a great topic to talk about their particularly, you know, particularly if you want to use it, you know, I think in general like
00:25:39 [W] The the good feedback. The best feedback is from the people that are trying to use it and often finding like that.
00:25:46 [W] It doesn't work for them and a great way to get involved is to address areas where it may not work perfectly for your use case.
00:25:54 [W] Like that's the others of the perfect PRS, you know, I mean taking another project and another so project and that's like those are the best PR sin that like, they're very focused and people understand their use case. Everyone understands their own use case very well, so
00:26:10 [W] Please you get involved there and attendant one thing. I did want to mention by the way.
00:26:15 [W] We moved the time slot I think a week ago or so for the main Sig cluster lifecycle meeting.
00:26:26 [W] It is now at 8 a.m.
00:26:29 [W] a m-- Pacific still bi-weekly still on the same schedule of weeks, but it is an hour earlier than it was previously.
00:26:35 [W] So if you are if you are showing up at 9 a.m.
00:26:28 [W] And no one is there you will now know why no one is there and I apologize if the video which may have been made before this change a reference 9 a.m.
00:26:35 [W] I wasn't sure.
00:26:39 [W] I don't see any other questions.
00:26:41 [W] Let me check slack quickly.
00:26:43 [W] See if anyone is asking in there.
00:26:46 [W] I don't see anyone in there, which is great.
00:26:49 [W] It looks like there are some excellent conversations going on about other talks.
00:26:52 [W] So it looks like the conversation will continue not like Beyond certainly Beyond this the time we have allocated.
00:27:00 [W] It. Looks like we have about a maximum of eight minutes left.
00:27:02 [W] So if there are any other questions and please do ask them. Otherwise, I know that the hallways at couponer crowded and that
00:27:09 [W] Moving to your next talk will be difficult.
00:27:12 [W] So you may want the extra time.
00:27:15 [W] The I hope I hope that the talk was informative and I hope that we will see at least some of you at the bi-weekly meetings where we can see each other and communicate better with each other and hopefully interact there.
00:27:30 [W] Do a final call for any final questions.
00:27:23 [W] Otherwise, we will I guess end a little bit early.
00:27:33 [W] going once
00:27:35 [W] going twice.
00:27:36 [W] Alright.
00:27:39 [W] I don't see any other questions coming in either on the slack or on the Q&A here.
00:27:45 [W] So a reminder.
00:27:45 [W] Oh, we have a question.
00:27:49 [W] Is there a mentorship program?
00:27:51 [W] There are so there are variety of that's thank you for the question.
00:27:56 [W] It's a great way like mentorship is a great way to get involved.
00:27:59 [W] I think in general the community is very welcoming.
00:28:01 [W] And so even without a formal mentorship program, there are you know, if you start to get involved you will receive what is elsewhere considered considered mentorship in that people will you know help you with your PR people will help you with the process.
00:28:16 [W] And the attend the meetings you can like raise those things your topics publicly.
00:28:20 [W] there are we
00:28:25 [W] Sig customer lifecycle and specifically the cluster add-ons sub-project participated in the Google summer of code internship program, I guess this year and that was good that I think there's also occasionally some
00:28:41 [W] quickly, the cluster add-on sub-project participated in the Google summer of code internship program, I guess this year and that was good that I think there's also occasionally some
00:28:50 [W] Events, so that's good. But it's it is very it only can accept a limited number of people.
00:28:57 [W] I think everyone involved felt it went very well this year and so hopefully next year we will expand our participation in that that but that it will be in the summer
00:29:12 [W] summer
00:29:15 [W] there are also occasionally events where for example, I think kubeedge DM has a couple of videos recorded where they Deep dive in their code and sometimes talk about the processes by which people can contribute. I think your baby m is
00:29:30 [W] Yeah, I think you're ready.
00:29:29 [W] I'm sorry the best project at encouraging people into the code.

00:30:02 [W] ship like experience and often, you know, people will be willing to engage with you on a sort of one-to-one basis around sort of some of the medic questions like
00:30:14 [W] Is this the right idea that sort of thing like am I approaching things the right way?

00:31:15 [W] In general but say like, you know, can someone help me understand like some aspect of how the full review process works or how I should be thinking about this or something like that specific question will probably get a better result
00:31:26 [W] Specific question will probably get a better result or clear outcome and there are you know, there is a wealth of resources out there.
00:31:35 [W] And I know that kubeedge Amazon great has some great Dives deep dives into these things.
