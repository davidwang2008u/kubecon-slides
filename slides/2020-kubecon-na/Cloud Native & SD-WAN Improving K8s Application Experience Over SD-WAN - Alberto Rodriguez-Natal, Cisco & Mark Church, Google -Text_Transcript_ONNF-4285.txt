00:00:00 [W] Welcome everyone to this - thank you.
00:00:02 [W] Thank you for learning.
00:00:03 [W] I'm a doctor in Natal Franciscan and Care within ourself from from Google and in this is it today.
00:00:11 [W] Ci/cd stay talk a bit more with one another. So in the session today, we are gonna start with an introduction of what is the current state of cognitive dissonance T1, and why it may make sense for them to integrate anymore
00:00:26 [W] Going to jump included the climate Instagram by open sourcing is this has an open source project we lease this past summer around the time of equipment Europe and in the talk today, we're going to go through
00:00:30 [W] And I said you an example of how these things first.
00:00:33 [W] Also we have another Click on each of the components.
00:00:37 [W] we will end up with a kid named we want to have a bit of a discussion at the end with you guys. So with that I will pass it to Mark we can start a conversation.
00:00:47 [W] Thank you, Alberto.
00:00:48 [W] So let's talk about why we're having this discussion the first place.
00:00:52 [W] What is the what is the intersection of kubernative? He's and wants and in some ways kubernative is a victim of its own success.
00:01:01 [W] So kubernative has become very common layer to deploy applications.
00:01:06 [W] So applications have a consistent execution environment no matter where the running and kubernative is is available as a managed version and all the primary Cloud providers.
00:01:17 [W] Ours are deploying them on Prem.
00:01:19 [W] So there's many ways many areas in which you can deploy an application on kubernative including many regions and areas of the network around the world.
00:01:28 [W] And so while applications can be deployed in a really consistent Way by using kubenetes the Clusters themselves may be homogeneous areas for these applications, but the networks between them are not and that is very much the problem that we're trying
00:01:44 [W] The problem that I think many kubernative operators have is you have applications that may be different applications may be the same instance are maybe different instances of the same application across Koreans clusters that are in different Cloud providers
00:01:58 [W] Since have accessed across different types of networks, and then in addition to that your users are in different areas, right?
00:01:54 [W] They are maybe Enterprise work from home users that are maybe Enterprise from your branch.
00:01:59 [W] And so providing the connectivity between your kubenetes.
00:02:03 [W] I hosted applications and your users is not easy thing to solve and this is very much what sdram ducks and so this presentation discusses.
00:02:12 [W] How do we bring these two technologies together?
00:02:15 [W] To help solve both of these problems and make the the process of connecting your community hosted applications across wide area networks in easier thing to do.
00:02:28 [W] So let's talk a little bit about what s deal and actually solves the first place.
00:02:32 [W] So software-defined.
00:02:35 [W] When is a group of Technologies offered by a lot of different companies that solve some of the challenges we have listed here.
00:02:43 [W] You have applications and end points across many different networks.
00:02:46 [W] You have users and clients across many different networks and you have heterogeneous connectivity between them and sdn takes this heterogeneous connectivity all these different types of network and unifies them.
00:02:58 [W] As a single controllable and program but when fabric so that your network operator now has a consistent view of the network.
00:03:06 [W] Ization perspective and so this provides the kind of benefits that are really needed especially as applications are deployed to multiple Cloud providers multiple regions and across multiple different kinds of Networks.
00:03:20 [W] And so now let's look at okay, we have these two groups of Technologies.
00:03:25 [W] How do we bring them together to kind of offer the competitive advantages and the complementary benefits that they each have so incredi is you have different attributes of your application.
00:03:36 [W] We understand what the application is.
00:03:39 [W] What zone region is the environment or provider annotations that maybe dictate different attributes about the application, of course the IP and Port where the altinity
00:03:50 [W] Application is accessible from perhaps, you know within that that provider or maybe with on it within the public internet and also characteristic about the app like it's health or how many replicas exist within the application.
00:04:04 [W] So those are things that are stored inside your kubernative cluster and then sd1 has its own attributes that it's that understands its own picture of the world. It understands attributes of the user and the client and its identity and location it understands.
00:04:19 [W] Attributes of the network Path Performance and health and what the connectivity looks like between the clients and your applications?
00:04:28 [W] Attributes and creating policy and and really these attributes are important for different personas. And as you see as we go through this presentation, you'll see that there are devops users or a poor service owners that are deploying their applications and communities
00:04:33 [W] a poor service owners that are deploying their applications and kubenetes and there are also netapp's users that are controlling the network and ensuring that there's a consistent secure and reliable Network between users and applications and if we have a policy based
00:04:37 [W] Connecting these together then we have a very nice and roll oriented way in which net offs and devops can work together.
00:04:44 [W] So that devops can have more control to defiant to determine the types of network policies that are applied to their applications and then netapp's gets the in understanding of how applications are being accessed and
00:05:00 [W] Are using them and so this provides a lot of benefits and over the next couple of slides Alberto's going to show you some of the open source technologies that were using to help users connect these two technologies together.
00:05:15 [W] All right.
00:05:16 [W] Thank you.
00:05:16 [W] Thank him out of those have fantastic introduction.
00:05:18 [W] So yes as much said let's spend some time now talking about open source and what we have done here.
00:05:25 [W] So this is about the the clown Atif Aslam project and the whole idea with the climate was one project is that you have today as the one on kubernative and the to may be, you know, running together perfectly fine and you have both the option at us making sure that
00:05:40 [W] My son and final borders, but this little integration between the two and we are missing some optimization opportunities.
00:05:43 [W] So the whole idea of the project is to notate this picture that you have here and make it a bit more colorful.
00:05:49 [W] So for each of the different services that we have running on the cluster and this example is so important video conferencing application that is composed of different microservices that have different requirements from the network with the few right? So the
00:06:04 [W] See what integration is to make me want to be more aware of what's going on and the application side. It's going on on the corner of the side so that it can provide insulation especifically tailored for each of the microservices that the plastic is happy.
00:06:11 [W] So with that let's take a look at the architect.
00:06:15 [W] So everything is passed from the the same picture.
00:06:18 [W] looking at the net option under the BOB So net Ops taking care of this one controller and devops taking care of equipment and it's probably all of you know, and the greatest
00:06:27 [W] Side a lot of his stuff with the prodyna example files they find your service.
00:06:32 [W] So the idea that someone introduces is that in that geometry specification the devops can put a really simple notation and we take a look at the notation a little in the in the presentation a very simple notation that Yeti specifies.
00:06:47 [W] Traffic for this particular survey looks like what you know is the kind of expectation that they sell this fast on the on the one side of things and that is something that then through the process that we're going to talk about right now.
00:06:51 [W] They see one can optimize for this particular type of service for the traffic that is Services generate. So once you have this annotation, elotl damage mitigation, there is a component that we call the same on operator that is running on the cluster and monitoring the
00:07:07 [W] No notation. And the moment in those is one cell. It has been annotated with these someone named italica. It passes information from external service registry and today we support for instance a world-class service director yesterday.
00:07:15 [W] Without series anything yesterday but this in turn can be any any zettaset is so what information is available and we know it has to be consumed of the services.
00:07:23 [W] We have another component that we call the same one reader that is retrieving this information from the from the service side.
00:07:28 [W] driven by the name of the service with the IP and Port so it knows you know how the service is looks like from the standard point of view from the other side of the world of kubernative and usually not as well the metadata.
00:07:41 [W] Associated with the settings so that it can then pass that information to one component. We call this in one of that and they deal with the same an adapter.
00:07:51 [W] is that this component is aware of how to interact with the ST1 controller. So you haven't have different someone adapter for its steep one solution you are using and they deal with the same when a doctor is that the net
00:08:06 [W] It's going to configure fast on this they want control at some policies from you know, ST1 policy such as the natives can do today.
00:08:13 [W] And then it's also going to go to the scene when adapter and tell the senator a look I have this policy is configured on on my controller.
00:08:21 [W] I want you to map these policies to the information about the services.
00:08:25 [W] We are receiving from kubernative so that way when a service is retrieved from the registry by the reader and pass it on to the to the adapter the doctor Knows by looking at the mayadata.
00:08:36 [W] Out of the service and looking at the mapping of quality metadata that the native seed which policy which is the one policies would apply to this service so it can pass this information about the you know that information about the service.
00:08:51 [W] One controller so that they see One controller can apply the proper policy for this episode. So I know that this was a bit maybe a bit too abstract and high level so let's let's look at you know what this means in line.
00:08:58 [W] I'm going to use these super simple example here.
00:08:53 [W] that is kind of showcasing a very common sd1 the climate.
00:08:59 [W] So a typical Enterprise may have multiple branches may be running some applications on the cloud SQL net tried and this in the bag wants to put up good connectivity between those renters and application.
00:09:13 [W] It is running on the top.
00:09:13 [W] So for that it deploys are nasty one. This is happening to their release is a common problem.
00:09:19 [W] Or on the ST1 side of kids usually you tend to have you don't need when you come to have multiple links over the over the network. So you can you know play with the different performance that we are seven of these attorneys and
00:09:35 [W] You can then add some salt. So in this particular example, we are solving an Instagram connection from Branch to Cloud that happens to go through on a high-speed Network that offers two different types of connectivity what we're calling the picture
00:09:47 [W] the network that offers two different type of connectivity what we call in the picture with the public in terms of business Intel as you can imagine looking at the slides so public internet this have suggested for connectivity
00:09:49 [W] Then this have suggested for connectivity very much for you can get that phone. Right and it has maybe lower language but also because we're so the Enterprise decides to put most of the traffic through the public internet possible,
00:10:04 [W] This has to put most of the traffic through the public internet impossible, but then it also has what we call this example business internet business internet connectivity that has high rank within they have also as well.
00:10:15 [W] Let's wait and see lower latency and so on but the thing is that it comes at a higher cost.
00:10:21 [W] So if you want to use the reasons internet you have to pee so that's why by default any traffic going from the from the branch to the applications and coming back goes to the public internet because it's cheaper but then
00:10:33 [W] Then you may have a particular service that requires more bandwidth for instance.
00:10:39 [W] So and you want to deliver a good language for this set.
00:10:44 [W] Let's let's say for instance that you have a service that is a video streaming application running on the cluster and then the natives has noticed that for video streaming.
00:10:53 [W] public internet is not delivering good enough performance. So the Nettles has set up a policy on land and water says okay when you see when you know, the
00:11:03 [W] Maybe some very specific for a particular video service.
00:11:06 [W] I want I wonder if they want to put a traffic on the business in-toto.
00:11:10 [W] So that's a policy that knative may have set up on the ST1 traffic and then the devops knows that it can use a notation on the community side using the CN 1 integration that is going to interact with these policies that the knative has produced in. So
00:11:25 [W] - to do is to okay annotate we service with similar notation and the natives and they both will coordinate and how those notations look like and by just applying that annotation and through the integration we have described with the
00:11:40 [W] All right, the traffic automatically shifts and starts using the business internet and this happened, you know under the scenes without any manual interaction on the top. So the top side just by the fact that you have this service with this particular
00:11:45 [W] Can you put in the ending that the knative snow is less for this particular type of stuff?
00:11:49 [W] So with that let's double click on each of the components of the of the scene one solution.
00:11:55 [W] So I'm going to you know to to offer a bit of an overview of these components and for you to not get too lost.
00:12:06 [W] I intend to put a diagram of the top pointing at which point company we are looking at that at every moment.
00:12:12 [W] So then we're looking at the addition operator. This is the component that runs within the qualities cluster. This is your typical.
00:12:19 [W] This controller that we have written in: and we do say Builders pain work and the idea with this is one operator again is to look for the annotations of services that you have an example of this annotation on the right.
00:12:32 [W] You see here for instance in one the Toyota is a file because with at this is a very good example for invitation and we use it as he falls in the you know, the prc's that we do with this technology.
00:12:45 [W] But again, this can be any kind of another source often as there is some
00:12:49 [W] understanding it with the devops and letters and which is the kind of connotation inspector. You can put anything that you think of and then you can configure the same one operator to understand them so notation.
00:12:59 [W] So this is going to put it again.
00:13:01 [W] Gamma, and we're making an effort to make the operator easy to install.
00:13:04 [W] So today we offer some scripts in also optimized Motors establishing plan your CTL, but we have some online efforts again to go over these three operator Hub. And of course to tufin for Philly station through Helm as well.
00:13:19 [W] On the link to the course so you can take a look at search.
00:13:16 [W] So the second component at the scene one reader this guy is the one that is running properly. It can run anywhere but it has certain closer to the to the ST1 control is closer to the to the thing on the planet.
00:13:30 [W] again, this is written on nonviolent again, and they deal with the same one readers that is monitoring the status register. They need service that will directly to that.
00:13:41 [W] Or DNS or it will start map of need if you do so any of those monitoring the distribution is for new new services and a notation for their services and the way it monitors those those services today.
00:13:55 [W] We support grpc Pauline towards Google cloud service directory.
00:14:00 [W] directory. We're also looking at some cough cough integration and once it detects a new a new service or new information from the system service, and so it's fast in that information to the adapter.
00:14:11 [W] If you remember is the the guy that is closer to the sd1 controller.
00:14:15 [W] So the way the reader has to interact with the adapter is through what we call that the same one events API that is an API that world the reason that dr. Have to learn and we would provide an opinion pi16 on the GitHub repository can take a look.
00:14:30 [W] This is an example of how this APA suit right?
00:14:29 [W] So this example is showing and Annie or cell service on the city's history that was imitated on the cluster with traffic profile equal be friends.
00:14:42 [W] this is you know, a plan example, depending on what you put in the cluster of how you configure the Creator. You may see different and metadata tickets yet. But the idea is that the grid is going to pass this information to their laptop. So this example is say I've seen a new streaming service that was
00:14:56 [W] skated is the IPM poor. So these are the different ways you can use to play densify the traffic over the ST1 and this is what the devil said about the about the service that they were set. Okay traffic fight for these services with you.
00:15:09 [W] So without we go to the 2001 adapter that is implementing the same one events API and taking care of this now the interesting thing about the the same one of that but it is that it's a specific pair Estevan control.
00:15:21 [W] So if you have a different Esteban Solutions, you need to do different adapter. So as of today, we only have one adapter that is for with the elastic one and we are now starting to work on
00:15:36 [W] Instagram so you can use any of those to an NES t1i solution.
00:15:16 [W] I'm happy again.
00:15:17 [W] It's an adapter and you know, the idea with someone is to be more than enough that anyone can write a not after for the word church.
00:15:24 [W] So since the only laughter that we have today is detailer as they can talk about because there is the there's nothing that ideas yet.
00:15:33 [W] So the way that it ended after Works in his office is written in Python using the Retailer's DK.
00:15:40 [W] The way it works, is it offers a map inside the eye that basically mlops The Limited Intel that it got from the reader from to a particular with telefonica C. So this is a specific to tell about if you look at the at the right.
00:15:55 [W] Elastic a the way, it works. Is it offers a map inside the eye that basically Maps the the metadata that it got from the reader from to a particular with Stella policy.
00:15:55 [W] So this is a specific to tell about if you look at the at the right side of this picture, you see for example climate I Taquito SQL file we value video. I want you to map it in this particular policy. And what we Define from its Ella is policy type
00:16:11 [W] Give you symptoms and profile with a new video. I want you to map it in this particular policy. And what we Define for the seller is policy type application.
00:16:21 [W] We're out in this specific policy that on big fella. So that is the one solution we have different policy types. And then then the net option this example created a policy a policy type of type application of Iraq in that was named optimized video and then another
00:16:37 [W] And my pin safety and adapter to configure the mapping between traffic profile video on the kubernative side of the world with application of routing optimized video on the Intel seldom an Indian elotl St.
00:16:51 [W] St. 1 Solutions May behave similarly social you can have similar model and we hope that the doctor will provide now should serve as an example or supporting other all achievements in the field. So with that we are the end of the
00:17:06 [W] station and we would like to have some Q&A with all of you.
00:17:10 [W] And before we jump into that we would like to throw some questions already the table at these are things that are we are asking ourselves and we don't have answers.
00:17:19 [W] Yes.
00:17:21 [W] We would like to see what you guys think. So one is okay Candis model apply not only to one but also to land right so we have discovered so far is for for Esteban connectivity of one connectivity dinner, but if you think of it nothing prevents kubernative for having a
00:17:36 [W] When you're going to specify requirements and you can specify the types of traffic and so on that I've said these guys and maybe I landed with a local area network.
00:17:40 [W] No your real network data center Network or whatever you have that may also render a specific Organization for those services.
00:17:47 [W] So that takes us to the second process of communication and a senior photographer.
00:17:51 [W] So we'll have answers for this.
00:17:53 [W] this. We have to have a conversation with you guys. You can set the bottom the GitHub repo with all the on the code.
00:18:01 [W] And we also have some documentation there.
00:18:02 [W] We have some some nice altinity on that the brings small GRC or not work out today. So you can also try that and also there is a weariness you can use in the some. So no sale and with that will happy to take any questions.
00:18:23 [W] Okay.
00:18:24 [W] Thank everyone for attending the session.
00:18:28 [W] So we we saw couple of questions on the tell we try to address those.
00:18:33 [W] Someone is asking if the slides will be posted on the scared. They should be there already. If not, let me know and I can make sure that they have that they should be there.
00:18:44 [W] Now someone is asking where does ST1 fit with other communities over the find network capabilities? You want to take that one mark?
00:18:53 [W] Thank everyone for attending the session so we saw couple of questions on the chat.
00:18:50 [W] We try to address those. Someone is asking if the slides will be posted on the scalp. They should be there already.
00:18:56 [W] If not, let me know and I can make sure that the entire body should be there.
00:19:02 [W] Now someone is asking where does ST1 fit with other communities over the fine Network capabilities? You want to take that one mark?
00:19:15 [W] See, which question?
00:19:16 [W] Yeah, so so when he's asking where dice is the one filled with other kubernative hdnet capabilities to get that mean so what if I never work abilities, so maybe you can answer that one.
00:19:28 [W] Yeah, I think so.
00:19:31 [W] This is a good question is we started asking when looking at St.
00:19:36 [W] When what kind of policies are required for for trafficking across the land and of course traffic policies.
00:19:43 [W] are not exclusive to just the way and there may be traffic policies that make sense in your Lan environment or even within inside the cluster and so there aren't formal definitions for these traffic policies yet, but we thought it would
00:19:58 [W] our for traffic going across the wind and of course traffic policies are not exclusive to just the way and there may be traffic policies that make sense in your Lan environment where even within inside the cluster and so
00:20:15 [W] His kind of spearheading the idea of policies for this kinds of traffic.
00:20:19 [W] This is just focused on the wind, but of course these all seeds really could extend to other areas of the network as well.
00:20:28 [W] That's right.
00:20:29 [W] Yeah some of the questions. Can you elaborate on this? The one controller? Is it an appliance cloud service?
00:20:36 [W] Yeah, that depends on the particular St. One solution that that you're using right?
00:20:40 [W] So some of them have an appliance some other have a cloud service from Hopper both so you probably want to check what your solution offers and they deal with the connectivity one project is that we just use
00:20:55 [W] So whatever your Cloud your anyone control it is to implement cloud is an applied and spiritual. We don't care as long as we have some apis to connect to that.
00:21:07 [W] So can this approach produce the same or similar qs4 as the one and then PLS? Yes. The idea here is that again?
00:21:15 [W] We configure policies according to what the ST1 the particularly one solution supports.
00:21:22 [W] So if you have a an easy one that maybe has some special emphasis on mpls and in the first song Some apis that we can use to configure some some policies or the net Ops can use to configure some policies and those can be mapped to traffic profiles on kubernative.
00:21:37 [W] this
00:21:40 [W] Okay, so when you comes in take wonderful care.
00:21:44 [W] Yeah, it's going to take one of the questions around the role of the St. Way and router. So in this case, the question has been can you comment on the role of the sd1 router is a supposed to be a standard kubernative Ingress or something more specific?
00:21:57 [W] So in this example, we are exposing the application via a load balancer that's deployed via kubernative service.
00:22:05 [W] It could be a career as Ingress in this case Korea s Service makes sense.
00:22:10 [W] a layer for VIP that's exposing just
00:22:14 [W] Some branch office and there could be a virtual one on the on the cloud side or on the side that the Koreans cluster.
00:22:19 [W] All right, we'll just support console as I don't see any step is covered equivalent in a secure and less paper. DNS may be an alternative.
00:22:27 [W] Yeah, that's a good question.
00:22:29 [W] We have been looking at us.
00:22:31 [W] You see what they have there.
00:22:32 [W] If someone helps opinions on what we can use on us. We're happy to discuss we haven't considered console right now, but you're bringing a good point so we can look into that and in general if you guys have any
00:22:47 [W] No services to that you've seen it seems that there's no what I need is the one solution we have done most of our development with Google Cloud servers directory and we are doing what we did that.
00:22:57 [W] should be agnostic. So anything can come fit.
00:23:04 [W] While plenty of questions is with tell us the one not supported in Google Cloud.
00:23:09 [W] Yeah, so that's a that's a good question.
00:23:14 [W] So we need to I need to get back with you and on the official answer because we have like Cisco has some support on this elastic one on Google Cloud.
00:23:25 [W] I don't know if that's available or not, but I can I can get back to you. I can post it on on the on the slack.
00:23:33 [W] And so if he's not there is going to be there pretty soon.
00:23:40 [W] So there is a question from David Bainbridge.
00:23:44 [W] Let's see, which one is removing around here.
00:23:47 [W] Oh, yeah, thinking about intra cluster traffic in a cluster on servers that are connected via Leaf spine fabric.
00:23:55 [W] for example in this situation.
00:23:57 [W] How do you see land policies playing a part? So these the I think the important thing here is more about the the Persona and how we're connecting the kubernative service owner with the ability to
00:24:12 [W] all seas and so if there is a policy provided by the network, and so let's say you have a spine Leaf architecture and your network infrastructure offers the ability of several different policies to choose from this at least
00:24:22 [W] Your network infrastructure offers the ability of several different policies to choose from this at least gives the service owner on the community side the ability to pick that policy in the language that they're using to deploy the application.
00:24:24 [W] And so that's really what this does here.
00:24:28 [W] And so it it depends a lot on kind of what policies are available in the network that the app is exposed on.
00:24:40 [W] Okay. Another one son is the one Bender. Can I somehow helped by for instance a student APA designed to fit more into the news of us in one project.
00:24:49 [W] Do you have any specific which has already complains that will be useful to have in mind when designing API for the domain controller which later on will be use for your adapters.
00:24:59 [W] Yeah.
00:25:00 [W] that's an excellent question.
00:25:01 [W] So if any of you listen to this talk is an NST one. Bender will be super happy to talk with you and to
00:25:09 [W] Buse and effort here to make sure that that we have something that says that the you know, the the most number of people as possible.
00:25:18 [W] So I guess at our request in general for 481 Benders is the more apis and the simpler they have to consume the better and if you have some capability that you don't expose be an API, it doesn't exist for us.
00:25:33 [W] That will be useful to have in mind when they sign in API for that you encounter, which later on will be used for your adapters.
00:25:39 [W] Yeah, that's an excellent question.
00:25:41 [W] So if any of you listening to this talk is a nasty one vendor will be super happy to talk with you and to to align abuse and an effort here to make sure that that we have something that says that
00:26:56 [W] Think of anything that you can do on your under arrest you want to make sure that we can do it through through the API. So think we can use that for the for the policies.
00:27:07 [W] Yeah, and an example of policies are so we have you know, St when policies there may be land policies and as a service owner in a kubernative cluster you if they're if they're different parts of the network that expose
00:27:22 [W] you might not want to have to specify what kind of policy is used in each area or you might not even have awareness of what parts of the network traffic is going through and so having a single definition of policy that's portable across different types of networks,
00:27:37 [W] A portable abstraction to kind of specify what kind of policy you want. Now, of course, this API doesn't exist right now, but this is what we've done here is an example of doing that kind of abstraction and having portable abstractions to specify those policies
00:27:52 [W] a nice Direction
00:27:53 [W] yes, as we mentioned on the on the recording right we have an initial on on GitHub to kind of track this discussing about the fake profiles and kubernative any opinion
00:28:08 [W] Phone on how Indian are going to look at up handling this kind of technique provides Network policies meaning you not to mention the traffic and so on qos and we're not going to be super happy to get some some opinions there and get some some ideas going.
00:28:21 [W] You know, look at how this should move on looking forward.
00:28:28 [W] Okay, we answer all the questions mark.
00:28:31 [W] Okay.
00:28:29 [W] Well, we got some good questions
00:29:02 [W] I'm pretty happy about the engagement and it seems like a lot of other people are seeing, you know generic uses for this as well.
00:29:08 [W] interesting as well to see the use cases that people see for each for cluster traffic. And so that's definitely an area. That would be interesting to look at one more.
00:29:21 [W] Now 52 to engage with us in slack through GitHub for which I mean to you fit properly and yeah any question or help we can announce it will be happy to do afterwards
00:29:38 [W] Okay, and I seen the last one we should take it to to slack.
00:29:44 [W] Someone is asking if this could be a standard to other Technologies such as the network layer to fabric. Yeah in general the answer is if you can write an adapter for that you can extend this model, so
00:29:58 [W] Alright. Well, thank you so much. We really appreciate it.
00:30:04 [W] Thank you very much.
