00:00:00 [W] Hello, welcome to extending servicemeshcon the edge. Let's get started.
00:00:07 [W] The agenda is actually very simple for this talk.
00:00:30 [W] Hello, welcome to extending servicemeshcon the edge.
00:00:35 [W] Let's get started.
00:00:38 [W] The agenda is actually very simple for this talk.
00:00:41 [W] We just want to talk about the motivation behind trying to extend servicemeshcon run on the edge some of the key challenges that you would face a demo that would provide a Solutions or our solutions for one of the challenges that we think exists.
00:01:08 [W] He challenges that you would face a demo that we provide a Solutions or our solutions for one of the challenges that we think exists and then we'll wrap it up by talk about some future plans that we have on a
00:01:23 [W] Want to project?
00:01:27 [W] Typically, when we anyone talk about Edge, the first thing they ask is that what do you mean by Edge and to address that it makes sense to take a little time to talk about where we came from?
00:01:38 [W] We came from a project called p.m. Every Clover and if we end of e is a number of project it stands for open platform for Network function virtualization.
00:01:47 [W] And if we have a function notation is basically the Telco loodse way of attempts to cloudevents work services.
00:01:57 [W] in
00:01:59 [W] Opa nov 12th is an integration testing projects where you take open source projects in a gray and together write some test cases and trying to make sure that they can actually address particular Telco and if we use cases particularly for Clover, we are interested to
00:02:14 [W] khlo need if we lead a Technologies open source projects and then trying to see what kind of energy use cases we can address and then in this case what we get feedback from users and then for after investigation is there's a very strong inclination from the users
00:02:29 [W] Use communities on other cognitive Technologies on mobile Edge namely what we call a me see which used to sample mobile ads Computing now is multi-access Edge Computing if you think about how close they actually have tremendous
00:02:29 [W] Site presents their Radio Networks, you know you only when your cell phone connected to to AT&T or someone there's a close proximity base stations that actually terminates your radio connectivity.
00:02:40 [W] So they have those sites that are in small buildings.
00:02:44 [W] So and then with compute Powers, so they have actually if you will up Micro Data Centers and that presence has been around for a very long time and then particularly for 5G upgrades because the bandwidth is so much bigger.
00:02:56 [W] Our and then what kind of applications an implication of the applications that would come in?
00:03:01 [W] They are stuck there.
00:03:02 [W] Let me see after this therefore.
00:03:05 [W] Taking advantage of that access computer powers and then allowing third party application owners of players to be able to utilize those compute Powers by running the applications.
00:03:17 [W] So we are not talking about sensors or devices when we talk about H, and therefore you don't see us doing something like virtual kubelet.
00:03:26 [W] We talking about some level compute power somewhere typically from single single digit number of servers to maybe a few racks.
00:03:35 [W] Of xxe x86 or Arm based servers sitting on the couch do note that.
00:03:43 [W] On that servers of the benefits of actually running the service match all the way to the edge and then going back to that use case.
00:03:50 [W] What makes sense for us in terms of deployment for kubenetes is that we want to run cluster and auto control controller cluster independently on the active sites obviously benefits is they are the benefits are actually pretty obvious right your if you
00:04:05 [W] You're going to reschedule the parts all the decisions and make locally. So you don't have to go back to the cloud just to just to restart and reschedule apart. And and that's not anything majorly controversial right now. I think for the last
00:04:15 [W] Desperate number of projects that are trying to address the use case of lightweight kubernative engines.
00:04:20 [W] So what we see here is something like a k3s from Rancher or micro k8s from Ubuntu are all example projects where they actually trying to address I lightweight kubernative cluster use
00:04:35 [W] And another one is if you have this kind of deployment what kind of application that we looking at?
00:04:41 [W] So going back to something like an MVC or any kind of each data center in Micro Data Centers, you are trying to run a single applications that have components that spans across both Edge and Cloud. So so that's that's what we get
00:04:56 [W] Source from the open area Community also alvear when the control things would be the control analytics and all that all that may be running on a cloud but then the the processing of frames and videos we were running on
00:05:06 [W] With all machine learning where the inference engine would actually be running on edge and all the learning capabilities are running on cloud or iot Gateway where some sort of filter is running on edge and then the call analytics engines will be running on cloud.
00:05:16 [W] So these kind of applications where they're basically single applications that spans across both have microservices running components that are running on cloud and components are running on edge.
00:05:26 [W] So we'll make an argument and then that's actually digits of this this presentation is that it makes
00:05:33 [W] Lot of sense to run a single mesh across the cloud and Edge sites for this kind of applications.
00:05:40 [W] The obvious one is that you know, once you do that, you have a consistent Network policy and Telemetry vomiting models across a single applications across different sites your cloud or Edge so you
00:05:55 [W] A single mesh across the cloud and Edge sites for this kind of applications. The obvious one is that you know, once you do that, you have a consistent Network policy and Telemetry formatting models across a single applications across
00:06:26 [W] The same train where you can you can treat it as basically just an extension on your applications.
00:06:31 [W] Just like how you would write it for any of those single measure applications that you have that runs in a single Data Center.
00:06:36 [W] And also it's Theo the major use case for is still really is ci/cd Pipelines.
00:06:44 [W] releases or red black testing A/B Testing type stuff for those things for stos particular angle measure actually running very well.
00:06:56 [W] Vinegar for example is already integrated with SEO for over a year now.
00:07:00 [W] So and then we do think that for this kind of features. The ability to do kind of releases ci/cd pipelines is critical for Edge deployments because physical access is very expensive for each site.
00:07:15 [W] Want to automate a process of deployments only reciting parts or things like that or basically fully automated to avoid having actually technicians accessing Edge sites all the time.
00:07:27 [W] So with all these benefits that is, you know, sort of obvious really why have no one done it before or why I haven't actually met so actually we thought about doing that as early as a
00:07:42 [W] I would say mid second half 2018 when Clover was in was in major development time at that time.
00:07:51 [W] Actually, we had a we encounter we investigate and we encounter a major blocker and that was actually test the I component called mixer mixer is a sto control plane component, which is actually an engineering Marvel is a very good idea.
00:08:05 [W] This is a theory what it does is because as you probably know an Envoy, which is the place
00:08:12 [W] Engine revving telephone if you will on on sto runs on every single part.
00:08:18 [W] So a society what we called sychar. So every part that gets pandu be a invoice I work low part that gets pain will be sto proxy, which is an Envoy running mixer.
00:08:29 [W] You should centralized that capabilities into instead of spreading of a thousand. So it doesn't really scale great idea, but then because mixer as the name indicated because you want to implement part of your network policies on the
00:08:30 [W] In mixer mixer is basically not a control plane component is actually a mix.
00:08:32 [W] I guess.
00:08:33 [W] That's what the name means a mix between data plane and a control point that and how Android works is every single first request that comes in for a session.
00:08:42 [W] They would first get funded into mixer and in the process it and then we say, we're not easy a on a to actually go before Android can proceed just by hearing that you would you would be you would know that it's actually pretty terrible to run that on the edge.
00:08:57 [W] Age you can ring you can actually run mix on the edge.
00:08:59 [W] I have a multi close to deployment you what they do Israel does sexual assume that you run a mixer also on the on the the other clusters, but then particular 4-H it doesn't make sense because your info back ends probably doesn't exist
00:09:15 [W] The most pretty heavy stuff I would say so if that's the case then your mixer may be actually running on cloud. And if all your request has to go to the cloud just to get mixer to say yes, that's just the kind of delay is actually completely unacceptable
00:09:28 [W] Thankfully for us during I think one either way. It's still 1.4 1.5 the community or Community decided to deprecate mixer.
00:09:31 [W] So it instead actually taking advantage of the rich set of filter capabilities Envoy that allows you to then income Implement those complicated policies and Technologies or parole your custom protocols directly on Envoy
00:09:46 [W] Actually having decentralized.
00:09:43 [W] come on components to do so and that in a way actually unblocks us for from moving forward.
00:09:49 [W] So now that we start to resume looking at running a still extending still to the edge again, one of the great things that you can do and when I could opportunity to innovate we when you run this tool to the edge is
00:10:04 [W] Again, one of the great things that you can do and when I could opportunity to innovate if we when you run a steel to the edge is extending it the sto capabilities the route Roots the policies into
00:10:16 [W] Sto capabilities the railroads the policies into influencing your choices of which when connectivity links that you're going to use so in here when I want to say when y area networks, I don't just mean why area
00:10:31 [W] Or definitions and you know because going between H2 Cloud. Usually you can go through for networking terms in go through Access Network you go through like Metro and then you and then you go through like the real one, which is either long halt or the Transcontinental links
00:10:46 [W] Now use when and it means like the combination of all of those and then when you are running when likes you can it's very typical now that you have multiple endings going from Edge sites to cloud or actually in the era of
00:10:58 [W] when software defining when the this software defined when capabilities with Dan be creating a lot of channels, even if you only have one or two physical when links for different reasons, like low latency or high bandwidth or you know,
00:11:09 [W] When links for different reasons, like low latency or high bandwidth or you know, or best effort and stuff like that.
00:11:13 [W] So those are between defined and then and then what we really want to see and then what we see the opportunity odd is to map the sto policies and rubber boots into different when things depends on what their characteristic is.
00:11:30 [W] And actually in fact this is this is going to be a very simple demo that we're going to run on this technology that we used before.
00:11:39 [W] We actually go into the demo descriptions the demo and disillusioned actually that we propose actually utilizes heavily on this technology that we developed as Coco visor her eyes. They used to be part of it was developed as part of
00:11:55 [W] But it has since spawned aisle and it's an independent project. Now what it does is it talks to a community's always steal controllers and then it the big thing is it actually connects with the Linux kernel through
00:12:09 [W] It depicts thing.
00:12:08 [W] is it actually connects with the Linux kernel through EPF technology iot wiser is a open source technology under Linux that actually would compile and load what we call BPF code into the kernel if you
00:12:24 [W] If you f I hope you know what BPF is but if you don't I probably don't have time to explain what we have is but then one liner would be is a kernel technologies that allows you to insert your code safely into
00:12:39 [W] Event points in a colonel. So for us for example would be the Ingress of a network device and egress of a network device. We can insert our own code in there and it's kind of safe the compiler ensures that it
00:12:54 [W] And then this so This is called Weiser runs the demon set of so it runs on every single node.
00:12:58 [W] and
00:13:00 [W] this so let's talk about a demo. The description will demo the demo. The setup is pretty simple set of actually I run two VMS on my MacBook through virtual box.
00:13:12 [W] So I'm creating to internal links between those two VMS each VM basically represents a cluster.
00:13:18 [W] I run a full kubernative clusters on each VM and think that so the master on terrorism all the Minions are in CO2 all other parts we schedule on just this one.
00:13:30 [W] Node and then I also utilize the sto multi cluster capabilities by deployment.
00:13:39 [W] So there's three different deployment scenario still the one we pick is replicated control plane separate Networks.
00:13:44 [W] This is because well the other two are shared control plane separate networks and share control plane same network.
00:13:53 [W] The last one actually doesn't really make a lot of sense for for practical purposes for weaveworks.
00:13:59 [W] I'm all for testing so we didn't use it.
00:14:02 [W] I think the second one which is to share control plane and separate networks that actually reflects much better on the cloud and H relationships, but then we still do the replicator control plane because it's the easiest to set up.
00:14:15 [W] As I mentioned earlier, there are two interfaces that are running between the two clusters.
00:14:19 [W] So the simulator when length so this is winning and winning be basically between two two.
00:14:24 [W] And that's so the idea is this is one is Theo cluster is still instance running on a cloud SQL instance running on a single cluster and
00:14:39 [W] And then when sleep wants to access any of this actually happened, it would go through a steel Ingress Gateway.
00:14:46 [W] And then the whole point is through out Solutions based on the route rules that you use to go to either V1 and V2.
00:14:55 [W] It would then select either one of the wildlings to map into that ground rules.
00:15:00 [W] So let's get right to the demo.
00:15:08 [W] Hi, so this is the demo screen which you see here is there are three Windows login to the edge node. And this is the cloud side.
00:15:19 [W] This is going back to that slide back.
00:15:22 [W] This is basically having actually been that would actually Maps minions to version 2.
00:15:28 [W] I've actually been and everything else to be one as you can see.
00:15:35 [W] They are.
00:15:37 [W] two interfaces to when interfaces that we simulate the simulator when interfaces one of his 1.3 in 2.3 and then if you look into
00:15:49 [W] The sto Gateway Ingress Gateway IP address which is when we are setting it up. We set up such dad the the C part here.
00:16:00 [W] as you can see
00:15:59 [W] they are.
00:16:01 [W] two interfaces to when interfaces that we simulate the simulator when interfaces one of his 1.3 and 2.3 and then if you look into
00:16:12 [W] The sto Gateway Ingress Gateway IP address which is when we are setting it up. We set up such dad the the sea pot here.
00:16:34 [W] sleep out here has a DNS rules that would forward to IP address of this guy when they're going to actually have been and then also the
00:16:59 [W] sleep out here has a DNS rules that would forward the IP address of this guy when they're going to actually have been and then also the envoy would intercept
00:17:14 [W] quit number
00:17:17 [W] if you look at it now.
00:17:21 [W] We set up a route that goes to the Ingress Gateway.
00:17:25 [W] So I'm glad we select that to interface 224 it out and if you look into
00:17:36 [W] Packet throw between it into the good thing about using this as a is hardly any packets.
00:17:41 [W] or actually there is really isn't any packets going through the two internal interfaces until you actually start folding stuff.
00:17:48 [W] So as you can see from that route rules here, we are looking at user minions and actually the second user that name is boss.
00:17:56 [W] So here this is boss the boss user code - you boss.
00:18:02 [W] So if it goes there it goes through interphase the first one interest and then if you use user minions,
00:18:12 [W] Still goes through this interface.
00:18:13 [W] So nothing gone through this.
00:18:16 [W] So let's get started. What we do here now is creating.
00:18:30 [W] creating a
00:18:34 [W] It's basically asking them to anything that matches Port City thousand and minions would then be rewrite into this and then four and then redirected over to this particular link. So again if you do boss
00:18:51 [W] If you do boss, it doesn't change anything.
00:18:54 [W] still going through this.
00:18:58 [W] if you are
00:19:01 [W] if you do Minions instead.
00:19:05 [W] You can see that it's now going through S9. So once again if you do boss
00:19:14 [W] It's going through this if you do minions.
00:19:22 [W] Let's go in through the sky.
00:19:23 [W] We have take some time.
00:19:27 [W] Yep, it's going through this guy.
00:19:29 [W] So that's a very simple demo to see with the railroads. So what actually really is happening under the hood then.
00:19:40 [W] so what was happening under the hood so basically
00:19:45 [W] The first thing you is clove. Izr you're loading a when mapping into a clove iser.
00:19:51 [W] When interface we learn the railroads from Mysterio T. So in this case, we do have to reapply that railroads over to to to to the edge also because it's still the even though is replicated control plane actually doesn't really
00:19:58 [W] You to the actual so because it's still the even though it's replicated control plane actually doesn't really sink the rules across different clusters.
00:20:00 [W] But anyway, so we run that we don't have it. We implement this and then in sleep on the edge side The Parsley has an Envoy which we load a luau the Lua filter.
00:20:14 [W] So what does allow future the do what it does is it's for everything that matches and altinity.
00:20:20 [W] Actually be rules or any actually he thinks that matches Port 8000 in this case because we use like I in down it hasn't actually changed to port numbers yet.
00:20:29 [W] It extracts the HTTP Header information and send it over to Clove iser.
00:20:34 [W] So khlo visor would for example, we basically match up the rules as they actually usually goes to minions then do something then clove iser takes that from Mysterio understanding what it is and then knowing that this maps to a particular new when links,
00:20:49 [W] And program ppf to then start routing things for this particular sessions to as 9.
00:21:00 [W] once that redirect roses in place
00:21:05 [W] anything that sleep sense that matches minions would then be routed into as nine when you think that descends to anything other than minions like boss in our downloads. It would still go through as eight go through a different when link so this is actually the
00:21:20 [W] What's going on inside?
00:21:21 [W] So basically what happens is on the full measured once we have a
00:21:29 [W] Rules settings for closers another one is to be able to read from is Tod.
00:21:34 [W] We have a luau filter on Raw filter on on an Envoy.
00:21:40 [W] So there were actually Four does actually be informations on new sessions coli so implements that Raul classifications Maps into recession informations and program DPF and subsequently all the packets with them before it into a different way and Link.
00:21:56 [W] For future enhancements.
00:21:58 [W] So this is cool. Hopefully you think this is good for future enhancements.
00:22:02 [W] What will some of the things we're looking at is let's say you actually have a very resource constrained H node where because invoice been deployed per as a container per pod
00:22:17 [W] Can you may not have relations to actually required as particular an edge maybe actually isn't needed particularly talking to users.
00:22:19 [W] There's really a difference between we're not your application cpu-bound was this iot bound you're a lot of times your applications in etch may not be very chatty.
00:22:28 [W] It may not be as chatty.
00:22:30 [W] It would it would actually be probably wasting resources to actually create that extra containers.
00:22:36 [W] So one thing you may want to do is to create Envoy that runs on
00:22:42 [W] That basically runs on.
00:22:45 [W] Sorry, the basically runs on.
00:22:50 [W] As a single entity where multiple Parts would be able to go through the same Envoy.
00:22:55 [W] So the Clovis apportion is kind of more simplistic.
00:22:59 [W] So when you when you deploy Envoy the first thing you do is and it container is that basically set it into to set the IP table rules so that you route all the parts Graphics or incoming or outgoing traffic Saint to Envoy.
00:23:13 [W] So close I can actually do this by using something called stock map which acknowledgement to to project silly
00:23:20 [W] folks they actually created this Achmed capabilities if you know TC splicing is basically the same thing except is programmable T3 spicing that allows you to switch packets from one socket to another socket so we can we can utilize segment capabilities and
00:23:35 [W] Container is that basically set it into to set the IP table rules so that you route all the parts Graphics or incoming or outgoing traffic Saint to Envoy.
00:23:37 [W] So close wiser can actually do this by using something called spok map which acknowledgement to to project psyllium folks. They actually created this stock map Kappa buildings, if you know TC splicing it's basically the same thing except is programmable TC spicing
00:24:21 [W] Eight and void as a non psycho entity, but then at least one printing space per no y1 / name. So it's Bruno because of security reasons any things that before going into Envoy are clear text.
00:24:33 [W] So you would you would at least trust everything in your name space to actually do the right thing in that being the case. Then you send it out onto a parolee named say it. / no because if you go out onto the node you do not is, you know, you're not want unencrypted
00:24:48 [W] I want to click on your face.
00:24:49 [W] So so this is actually something they were exploring.
00:24:53 [W] Some of the hard thing is to make sto works with non sychar Envoy another thing that very quickly because it's almost time is how to actually ship locks.
00:25:06 [W] So right now this is not really part of the sto control plane.
00:25:09 [W] It's not easy OD the the lock collectors the trace collectors and the metrics collectors are all separate entities that you have to deploy yourself.
00:25:18 [W] It really doesn't make sense to deploy that an edge.
00:25:20 [W] So we would like to figure out the solutions that you can but you still want that Telemetry information is the login information. The metrics information is the trace information particularly.
00:25:31 [W] I'm very useful.
00:25:32 [W] So one of the things to think about is, you know, can we store them in batch and sending out or instead of you know, do we do we want them to keep on sending it when you're always utilize when by keep on traces are pretty taxing because
00:25:47 [W] I think this whole configuration is opentracing Senate races to spans all the time.
00:25:53 [W] So out of the Pod, so this is pretty frequent operations, if you have a complicated applications, so this is one thing to really think about moving forward on how to address this on an edge cloudevents.
00:26:15 [W] With SD when this will definitely be very powerful moving forward and then for the future we would if you have any resource constrained or concerns on psychiatrist and all the control traffic in general. There are two major areas to
00:26:26 [W] We do want to conclude by saying that we believe that edge Computing is as much if not more of a networking problem as it is a Computing problem.
00:26:21 [W] So that being the case I think you know application needs to be aware that they were running on edge instead of on cloud and then and then infrastructure needs to be invested heavily on how to solve the problem on a networking perspective.
00:26:38 [W] So if you want to contact me if you're interested in the project, please contact me.
00:26:42 [W] This is closed eyes the project, you know, and the code is actually in GitHub clover as a co-writer.
00:26:47 [W] Thank you for attending because I know this is but I'm you guys look at this session.
00:26:55 [W] It will be one of the last ones when the event so with that I thank you very much for staying and attending and you guys have a nice weekend.
00:27:13 [W] Hello.
00:27:13 [W] Thank you for attending.
00:27:15 [W] I see there are four questions here now.
00:27:18 [W] I think I answered the first one but let's do it again. Have we tested them with his can disconnecting the scenarios?
00:27:24 [W] No, and then but then one would imagine what we need here is the ability to detect a network interface going down and then actively removing the redirect Rules From the Source interface and
00:27:44 [W] Hello.
00:27:45 [W] Thank you for attending.
00:27:46 [W] I see there are four questions here now.
00:27:50 [W] I think I answer the first one but let's do it again.
00:27:52 [W] We tested them with this can disconnecting the scenarios.
00:27:57 [W] No and then but then one would imagine what we need here is the ability to detect a network interface going down and then actively removing the redirect Rules From the Source interface and that should be that
00:28:38 [W] Tribute, that could be an enhancement but no I have not tested at thank you.
00:28:43 [W] The second question is how secession created from BP f 2 2 2 and Roy that's actually a very very good questions and and it's actually not fully functional yet.
00:28:57 [W] I'm trying to explore if so today what we can get from a luau filter is the s model user info but then this session info that is needed.
00:29:08 [W] It is at the very least.
00:29:10 [W] We need to get the information about the source The Source IP address and Source Port so we are so I'm actually still in the middle of exploring how to do that using the envoy a network structure that the network filter currently available in propagating
00:29:25 [W] To the luau filter, which is actually the thing that I'm really actively working on right now just to make it work a little better.
00:29:32 [W] The the Clovis iot BPF rules are on the English side destinations coredns and IP and then on the way back, it will basically be the original source and the destination.
00:29:46 [W] Well the that would be actually be the source and the source which is actually the previous test and then sending it back to the original.
00:29:55 [W] Interface IP and Mac, so that's the rules that we need the able to actually look up info because user user is what we can look up on the envoy filter, but then by the time it hits ppf, obviously everything's encrypted wouldn't be able
00:30:10 [W] The next question is what kind of edge devices that support it with this on base would be find that would be okay.
00:30:13 [W] So there's there's nothing x86 related inside your code. So so far I although I do questions whether or not you actually run very low level things with with this deal and Envoy, but then I did talk about if you are doing it you
00:30:29 [W] a share control plane just do a still be running actually on edge and then and then the doing maybe a single instance and for you / namespace her node, but I but it does work on it should work on arm and
00:30:39 [W] Like if you're supporting tracing how would you standardizing transmitting context?
00:30:40 [W] several Hydro systems in use
00:30:44 [W] how would you standardize transmitting contexts?
00:30:48 [W] transmitting context meaning that you are so you want to be able to know what source it came from when you when you actually
00:31:03 [W] 222 followed the several headers systems in use. So in that case
00:31:12 [W] so to the only so the tracing I actually want to know if this question pertains to tracing natively by Clovis or do you mean the tracing opentracing they're supported by Envoy today the pertaining to the last the last slide
00:31:27 [W] Actually asked that question up there.
00:31:34 [W] Everything on clove izr or you're asking about tracing on.
00:31:39 [W] on tracing natively supported
00:31:44 [W] my Android today.
00:31:49 [W] so
00:31:53 [W] yeah, so I for one if you are.
00:31:59 [W] So for for me, actually I that's going back to the Fitz if the former opentracing opentracing doesn't specify why Porter.
00:32:17 [W] So Envoy, so you talk about one voice?
00:32:49 [W] So Envoy, so you talk about one voice?
00:33:24 [W] In this case the open opentracing asking about opentracing.
00:33:36 [W] dies
00:33:42 [W] it has to be actually while so in this case you are you asking about when we can create a system on the future enhancement.
00:33:49 [W] I guess you read that question you ask is actually more for future enhancement where you want to patch the traces from Envoy and try to send that over to to the cloud.
00:34:21 [W] Opentracing so you wanted you wanted a couple traces that come from Envoy in a be able to aggregate on the air side.
00:34:33 [W] In in that case, I mean there's several things that we could do, but then I have to admit I haven't it was a future enhancement. So I have who I don't actually have a really detailed Zahn.
00:34:48 [W] Envoy in a be able to aggregate on the air side.
00:34:55 [W] in
00:34:58 [W] in that case, I mean there's several things that we could do, but then I have to admit I haven't it was a fusion has been so I have who I don't actually have a really detailed on how to do it
00:35:14 [W] Actually be something to think about moving forward for sure.
00:35:24 [W] Okay.
00:35:24 [W] Well more questions.
00:35:25 [W] Can we also Incorporated a while filter script or any script as part of the sto Ingress Gateway which could hardly a risky way to behave with control holding risky. We behave that's that's a list your questions
00:35:40 [W] You can you can put you can load and luau filters into any of the envoy incenses including Ingress Gateway, although I actually personally ever try it.
00:35:48 [W] Trace context package Trace context package you Spire Jaeger
00:35:54 [W] the context so some by my understanding for for Envoy traces because I actually investigated at doing Clover is that they use the HTTP header to to to specify what request it actually came in from throughout
00:36:11 [W] For for Android traces because actually investigated at doing Clover is that they use the HTTP header to to to specify what request it actually came in from throughout.
00:36:35 [W] When that happens the the opentracing API that they call has a request ID and a session ID. I believe there was no no, that's how they create all the all the spans are coming from the same
00:36:50 [W] I think I think Trace idea and it was idea actually Trace idea and request ID. So they pulled out into the HTTP header over.
00:37:01 [W] I don't know if this actually changes anything.
00:37:20 [W] Any other questions?
00:37:24 [W] This if not, it's pretty much time.
00:37:27 [W] So, thank you.
