00:00:00 [W] Hello everyone.
00:00:01 [W] My name is Sebastian question.
00:00:02 [W] I'm the co-founder of trigger meshmark coming to my virtual Cube con North America 2020 talk the title is serverless or service fool and here I am recording
00:00:18 [W] Our service full and here I am recording and I hope you're going to have a good time listening to this to this talk.
00:00:27 [W] So let's go and let's have let's get the party started.
00:00:30 [W] We've come a long way.
00:00:33 [W] We've gone a long way since kubenetes was started, you know, June July 2014.
00:00:39 [W] It's been six years little bit little bit of it six years. So it's been it's been a it's been a while and and yes, we've come we've come
00:00:47 [W] a long way. So kubenetes was created and was donated to the cloud knative computing Foundation cncf right at the beginning.
00:00:56 [W] There was only one was great.
00:00:58 [W] And and now, you know, the ecosystem has exploded there lots of lots of things lots of software lots of companies that part of cncf and I'm not showing the the landscape to to criticize
00:01:13 [W] And cncf right at the beginning there was only one was great. And and now, you know, the ecosystem has exploded there. Lots of lots of things lots of software lots of companies that
00:01:47 [W] Extremely happy to see this because in six years an entire Community has been has been created additional software have been created and it's been really really, you know, really interesting and enjoyable and over
00:02:02 [W] I think there's been three main narratives that have fueled this development of this ecosystem one big narrative has been containers versus vm's, right? We were busy doing VM orchestration.
00:02:16 [W] We were busy doing openstack Cloud stack deployment and there's been this switch from openstack to communities.
00:02:22 [W] We started dealing with containers AS application package and definitely that's been a huge narrative. The other narrative has been
00:02:31 [W] You know saying hey, you know, we shouldn't focus on and and differentiating code right? So we should only work on code that brings value to the business and we should delegate boring things, you know boring quotes, right?
00:02:46 [W] Bringing Direct Value doesn't have direct almost IP intellectual property.
00:02:49 [W] We shouldn't really focus on it and the third narrative has been hey, you know, what if we don't focus on undifferentiated code we shouldn't focus on undifferentiated infrastructure as well.
00:03:01 [W] Right?
00:03:01 [W] So, you know what?
00:03:02 [W] I'm not here to manage a community's cluster.
00:03:05 [W] I'm not here to manage a calf cluster. Somebody somebody else should do it for me. Right?
00:03:10 [W] So we've had those three narratives that have helped.
00:03:14 [W] Craft this new ecosystem, right?
00:03:17 [W] So what has happened, you know because of those narratives now, we live in this multi-cloud environment and I'm not saying multi-cloud for marketing reasons and so on is just yeah, it's just multi.
00:03:29 [W] It's very it urges.
00:03:30 [W] So we have on-premises stuff. We've gone away from openstack from basic ZM infrastructure. And now we have containerd orchestrators based on kubernative.
00:03:44 [W] We have openshift. We have VMware tons.
00:03:47 [W] Ooh, we have Rancher all of that on premises even though they can talk to the cloud. Anyway, so we have that on premises. If we don't want to do this on premises stuff, then we use a generic cloud like AWS Google, you know as your
00:04:02 [W] Original cloud like my buddies in Switzerland exascale, right and we can manage our communities questers on those generate clouds, but we also have very specialized dedicated clouds. You want to you want somebody to manage your elastic search
00:04:10 [W] Go to elastic you want somebody to manage your calf cluster go to conference. You want to store your metrics somewhere datadog Salesforce customers, right?
00:04:05 [W] So we have very dedicated clouds SAS offerings that have emerged and all of this makes it a very multi-cloud environment, right and they're very good reasons for this again back to the indifferent and
00:04:20 [W] Again back to the end if French and the French eating quotes, you know bits, right?
00:04:25 [W] We want to run, you know critical pieces on premises.
00:04:29 [W] We want to keep that close to ourselves, but the in different shading components we want to delegate that right? So we run on premises stuff, you know that are critical if we want we delegate infrastructure management to the cloud we
00:04:44 [W] right, so we run on premises stuff, you know that are critical if we want we delegate infrastructure management to the cloud we use a managed service and then we have those dedicated offerings because you know, what who best to
00:05:01 [W] This and then we have those dedicated offerings because you know, what who best to manage my calf cluster than confirmed. Right?
00:05:09 [W] Well, you know nobody so might as well might as well use them, right? So they're very good reasons for this multi Cloud environment.
00:05:16 [W] It's not you know, it's not marketing.
00:05:19 [W] It's not it's not nothing right so multi-cloud, you know almost natural. It happened with those narratives, you know pushing us. And and now we know I like to do a flashback.
00:05:31 [W] Back to what's a cloud?
00:05:32 [W] What's a crowd? You know, if we go back to 2005 2006 definition from nist, you know, and they say well 3 5 but lets lets you know just focused on three characteristics its on demand.
00:05:47 [W] Measured service. So, you know exactly there's metering, you know, exactly how much you're using and then elasticity right? You need more you get more we need less you get less.
00:05:59 [W] Alright, so those were the three maybe three of the five the other ones, you know network access, which is almost a given resource pooling, you know, kind of multi-tenancy stuff, but on-demand metering elasticity three big
00:06:14 [W] Of the of the cloud right?
00:06:17 [W] You know, that's what we had that at the beginning and even then people, you know, where of course arguing about the cloud and you know, well, there's no clouds just somebody else's computer.
00:06:27 [W] Yeah.
00:06:28 [W] You're right.
00:06:28 [W] It's somebody else managing those those servers first time.
00:06:32 [W] I'm going to say servers doing a better job at it then then you are right, but it gives you on demand capability elasticity and metering so that
00:06:44 [W] Was the the cloud and now when we look at serverless, you know, I like to do this this parallel, right?
00:06:50 [W] So let's let's remember the definition of cloud. And now let's look at serverless. Everybody's going to argue that the poster child of serverless these days is AWS Lambda and when you look at the features of AWS Lambda
00:07:06 [W] Custom back-end Services.
00:06:56 [W] That's where you build your API server.
00:06:59 [W] Bring your own code right bring your bring your own workload fault tolerance built in from the cloud completely automated infrastructure, right, you know fully automated infrastructure. You don't see where it's running and it's managed for you
00:07:14 [W] Completely automated infrastructure, right, you know fully automated infrastructure. You don't see where it's running and it's managed for you. So managed service basically automatic scaling right? So you need more you get more you need less, you know,
00:07:21 [W] Basically automatic scaling right?
00:07:24 [W] So you need more you get more you need less, you know, it runs on less and then only pay for what you use that's metering right?
00:07:32 [W] So, what do you see here? Well, you see on demand you see metering and you see what's the last one elasticity, right?
00:07:41 [W] So the features of lumber looks a lot like, you know, the core definition of cloud computing from more than 10 years ago.
00:07:48 [W] All right.
00:07:49 [W] I find that fascinating.
00:07:51 [W] And now when you try to give a definition to serverless, well, the internet is, you know coming back to help you same way that they were saying.
00:07:59 [W] Well, there's no cloud is just somebody else is, you know, running your computer.
00:08:03 [W] Well, there is no serverless of course their servers, but it's just somebody else's you know, fully manage infrastructure and and you pay for what you use so it's a cloud right?
00:08:15 [W] So anyway, and that's what that's what we're seeing.
00:08:18 [W] Right?
00:08:18 [W] we have this, you know new multi cloudevents.
00:08:21 [W] Environment. All right, and when you look at the characteristics of this multi Cloud environment, it's from the beginning on demand elastic, you know and then metering and it turns out that suddenly everything is looking more and more serverless the
00:08:36 [W] Are saying well it's serverless.
00:08:37 [W] Yeah, it's serverless for you if you're using it, but it's not serverless for them.
00:08:41 [W] So I love this picture from a medium post from Tableau Laurie.
00:08:46 [W] Oh, you know giving reference where it's due and if you look you know, Lambda is, you know, sir serverless for compute, but then there is a pi Gateway, which is a serverless component is three suddenly is becoming serverless
00:09:01 [W] Each Amazon dynamodb dynamodb or even there is or has serverless.
00:08:54 [W] It's becoming serverless could need to is used in serverless applications, right?
00:08:59 [W] So when you look at all the cloud offerings of the main generic clouds you realize that more and more they are branding those offerings are serverless, right?
00:09:09 [W] traditional cloud is also becoming serverless, okay?
00:09:17 [W] And of course it's at is as it should be that's the real definition of cloud on demand elastic and metering you pay for what you use. Of course, you know, the clouds are serverless for you right there doing the job for you
00:09:32 [W] Should be that's the real definition of cloud on demand elastic and metering you pay for what you use. Of course, you know, the clouds are serverless for you right there doing the job for you the undifferentiated,
00:09:46 [W] Differentiated, you know management of the infrastructure that you don't want to do. They're doing it for you.
00:09:52 [W] All right. Hope that makes sense.
00:09:55 [W] Hope that makes sense.
00:09:56 [W] So let's let's keep going and try to have you know, fun with it.
00:09:59 [W] So now then the question comes up what happens when you don't manage the infrastructure you delegate the specialized Focus you delegate to specialize clouds, or I'm trying to read the slides, but you delegate to specialize clouds
00:10:15 [W] French sitting business logic.
00:10:17 [W] All right, so you delegate to to specialized class like datadog to store your Matrix.
00:10:23 [W] You don't want to manage the infrastructure you using gke right and you concentrate just on your business logic what happens right?
00:10:31 [W] Well you go service full which is really a better term than serverless right you go service fool. You have Services everywhere, right because you just traded manage.
00:10:44 [W] Ping servers with managing services and here.
00:10:48 [W] I like to cook Patrick DuBois was one of the creators of the devops movement and he said, you know as far back as you know, February 2017 in Ghent Belgium config management Camp.
00:11:03 [W] He said well, you don't manage servers you just use services. So we shouldn't say serverless, but we are going service full.
00:11:12 [W] All right, and that's really good and that's really what we're trying to do from the beginning as people developing and deploying application, you know developing the apps and operating the apps.
00:11:25 [W] That's really what we're trying to do.
00:11:27 [W] We're trying to be serviced full right? So my co-founder marking called publish this post recently on devops to devops. You can find it in the in the new stack and really, you know, I'm also mentioning it because Patrick as
00:11:41 [W] Almost, you know, we were all facing the traditional old world of Monolithic application and siloed organization death jobs. And then we try to create best practices better, you know engineering practices
00:11:51 [W] and then we try to create best practices better, you know engineering practices and that's where the devops movement emerged the main Foundation of all of this was trying to go faster, right and as you try to go faster
00:11:52 [W] They're right.
00:11:53 [W] And as you try to go faster you want to dedicate you want undifferentiated bits.
00:11:59 [W] What doesn't really bring value to the business you want somebody else to do it somebody whose business it is to do it.
00:12:05 [W] And so that you can concentrate on the stuff that your business really does and offers.
00:12:10 [W] All right.
00:12:11 [W] So ultimately, you know, what we're saying at trigger mentioned that you move to devops, right? You're building the app.
00:12:18 [W] you're deploying the apps, but you don't really care about the in-toto.
00:12:22 [W] Infrastructure, right. So, you know, you're more of a devops person and it's devops practice.
00:12:29 [W] That's really service for. Okay.
00:12:33 [W] So your multi Cloud environment could be as everything on a single generic Cloud could be multiple generic clouds, you know could be that you have on premises stuff that are very critical, you know for security
00:12:49 [W] And then you maybe you still use a dedicated car like datadog store your store your Matrix, right?
00:12:54 [W] there different, you know things that could happen here in your environment as you go service full and you delegate
00:13:04 [W] That makes sense.
00:13:06 [W] So what's the challenge the challenge is that now? You need to bridge all those things?
00:13:10 [W] All right, you need to bridge from one program to Dedicated Cloud.
00:13:14 [W] You need to bring you need to bridge from dedicated to you know eks, you need to bridge Salesforce from MKS right manage.
00:13:26 [W] Kefka on on AWS, right?
00:13:29 [W] big challenge you need to bridge those services. So
00:13:33 [W] No, this is not a pitch top, but definitely that's what we do at trigger meshmark star Vision.
00:13:40 [W] That's why I'm here talking to you about this.
00:13:42 [W] We're building bridges right we're building bridges to link events sources to event targets or even sings and in the middle, we have those Brokers, right? So that's what we do
00:13:58 [W] - we build Bridges between services that can exist on Prem in dedicated cloud or generic Cloud.
00:13:57 [W] So, how do we do this?
00:13:58 [W] Well, you need some group a lot of what we do is gluing stuff together, right?
00:14:05 [W] So you need bunch of glue.
00:14:06 [W] You need some breaks.
00:14:08 [W] breaks. All right, you need services that need to be stitched together and doing it. You need to avoid making spaghetti. You know, I had a chat Maybe.
00:14:19 [W] Be a year and a half ago.
00:14:20 [W] I with Joe BEDA one of the founders of trigger meshmark.
00:14:23 [W] know of course kubenetes.
00:14:26 [W] Sorry. And you said yeah, that's great Sebastian, but you need to make sure you're not making spaghetti.
00:14:31 [W] Yeah, that's right.
00:14:31 [W] You want to avoid making spaghetti?
00:14:33 [W] Even though spaghetti is very good, right?
00:14:35 [W] So, how do you how do you do this?
00:14:38 [W] How do you build those bridges?
00:14:39 [W] Well, you know, you need to use a lot of these events.
00:14:43 [W] All right, all these systems that are disconnected and sometimes mapping of
00:14:49 [W] And managed by different people. They have different organizational boundaries.
00:14:53 [W] They all emit events.
00:14:55 [W] All right. So these events is really, you know, the glue or the substrate between all those Services.
00:15:01 [W] All right and cncf helps you with the cloudevents specification.
00:15:05 [W] All right, so you have those events flowing and then everything needs an API.
00:15:10 [W] It's as old as the cloud or even you know before that.
00:15:13 [W] Automate things so we have events and then all those Services. Of course, they have an API.
00:15:08 [W] All right, and then of course we need Services, right?
00:15:14 [W] So you have Services everywhere and they're elastic you can use them on demand and you pay per use characteristic of a cloud service.
00:15:22 [W] All right, so that's what you need to you know, build those service full applications.
00:15:30 [W] So the API, right?
00:15:32 [W] What's the the API? Well kubenetes to the risk. You see our D Kasten resource definitions.
00:15:39 [W] If you need to extend the community say Pi you define your cri-o is you have a declarative API you write your reconciliation Loops in your controllers.
00:15:49 [W] Suddenly, you can manage all of that with the gitops mindset the same gitops mindset that you have for your other workloads.
00:16:00 [W] The foundation.
00:16:02 [W] Alright, so we are going service fool.
00:16:05 [W] We can use the cloud dedicated Cloud generally cloudevents and so on we can use on-prem. Suddenly. We have a common layer. We have this kubenetes built API.
00:16:18 [W] right cri-o. Yes, but then the proof is in the pudding. Look Google has come up with config connector, which is kubenetes API on top.
00:16:29 [W] P products Amazon has the ack AWS controllers for kubenetes and Azure as Azure service operator.
00:16:29 [W] So all the cloud providers are agreeing that fronting all their services with a communities looking API is the way to go so suddenly they expose an API
00:16:44 [W] You have cri-o is if you could have the same thing for dedicating clouds, you know, you're onto something right?
00:16:36 [W] So that's why we do a trigger measure.
00:16:40 [W] So those bridges that I mentioned those bridges to link all those Services.
00:16:45 [W] You know, how do you how do you make them happen?
00:16:47 [W] Well, you build an API, of course, you be able declarative API that's going to say.
00:16:52 [W] Hey, I need a bridge between this and that because that's what I'm trying to do. Right? So we have an object called kind bridgecrew.
00:16:58 [W] Each and then we have a bunch of objects like Salesforce Source. We have Splunk targets. We have transformation objects, right?
00:17:07 [W] So we have all of this represented as cri-o s we have controllers and with those suddenly you can define those bridges you can go service full right and you can you know, get to the real
00:17:23 [W] Is the promise of the cloud on demand elastic and pay as you go?
00:17:27 [W] So I'm running out of time.
00:17:28 [W] I need to be mindful even though I'm recording I could go on forever here.
00:17:32 [W] Okay, but you know, you know product of course, we have an API we have a nice-looking front end here is just a quick snapshot that I put in there.
00:17:40 [W] you can define those events sources that are flowing through the system from Google storage from as your event hub from AWS Cognito, you know oracle Cloud if you want Oracle
00:17:55 [W] Mid write all those different services are emitting events.
00:17:51 [W] They're saying hey I changed right they're emitting a notification that said hey something changed and then we take those events.
00:18:00 [W] We rub them we transform them and you can go to a destination and once you get to a destination, then certainly can go and perform a task, right?
00:18:11 [W] Where it gets very interesting in all this narrative that we're doing and all this ecosystem that has boomed.
00:18:17 [W] is that even this going service full which my entire point is that you know, when you say serverless you really mean service full and even driven.
00:18:28 [W] right? So as you go towards even driven application that are multi-cloud, you know, if you go like this and you embrace the know the landscape you fall back on your feet because everything can be managed as a
00:18:40 [W] Trances API object, so that's beautiful.
00:18:44 [W] So here's just a snapshot of like a trigger meshmark space.
00:18:47 [W] We have bunch of controllers running for the different sources the different destinations, you know, our transformation engine or you know, trigger flow controller, right?
00:18:58 [W] But if you're an operator you're familiar with this you can manage your event driven applications that are bridging those Services together and you could also the same way manage gcp offering manager.
00:19:10 [W] Because everything can be managed as a community's API object.
00:19:09 [W] So that's beautiful.
00:19:11 [W] So here's just a snapshot of like a trigger meshmark space.
00:19:14 [W] We have bunch of controllers running for the different sources the different destinations, you know, our transformation engine or you know, trigger flow controller, right?
00:19:24 [W] But if you're an operator you're familiar with this you can manage your event driven applications that are bridging those Services together and you could also do the same way manage.
00:19:35 [W] DCP offering manage your SQL SQL you manage your dynamodb, you know tables and things like this all the same way.
00:19:43 [W] That's the that's the power.
00:19:45 [W] So in practice use cases, of course use cases.
00:19:51 [W] So what are we seeing out there?
00:19:52 [W] where we're seeing a lot of people that are wanting to go service for all right. They're wanting to go service full can be can be a case of you know governance with very strong auditing week.
00:20:05 [W] Quirements, right, you know people wanting to say hey, I need to keep track of what's coming out of my static code analysis. What's coming out of my Jenkins? What's coming out of my big buckets? Right?
00:20:17 [W] I need to get all these events, you know, and then I need to act on them.
00:20:22 [W] I need to you know, do some processing of these events and then, you know, send them back to you know, a special, you know, data lake or storage system and so on so that I can validate.
00:20:35 [W] Later on all my my audits, right?
00:20:38 [W] So a strong use case we're seeing is devops governance, especially in Insurance big financial institution other use cases, you know Salesforce to back end, you know back and back office right
00:20:53 [W] A strong use case we're seeing is devops governance, especially in Insurance big financial institution other use cases, you know Salesforce to back end, you know back and back office right back
00:21:08 [W] To you need to sync between those two systems dedicated Cloud, you know run by Salesforce where you have all your customers and so on and then, you know keeping keeping your back office in sync and you want to be able to link link the two.
00:21:23 [W] and why do you want to use trigger meshmark because you don't want to manage those undifferentiated code which are you know, Salesforce eventsource targeting kefka, you don't want to maintain and and and
00:21:36 [W] An operator all of this, right and then the final one which is, you know, just a new one that's coming up that you know that we have and not putting much details here. But Health Care is also becoming, you know, very interested
00:21:51 [W] Services involved in healthcare, so, you know Google Health Care API to you know, manage a lots of sensitive patient data, potentially Google Health Care API, but you still want to use a WS so you want to be able to send those
00:22:04 [W] To any AWS service, right?
00:22:04 [W] So the bottom line, you know, the conclusion here is that we're talking about serverless and a lot of people are getting hung up.
00:22:12 [W] You know, where are the servers and school?
00:22:14 [W] So they're still servers what you're really trying to do you're trying to build even driven applications that are service full they compose a lot of services on premises Services dedicated cloud.
00:22:29 [W] Datadog Salesforce and then, you know generic cloud like AWS and Google you're trying to link all those Services.
00:22:38 [W] you're going service for much better term.
00:22:41 [W] Thanks to Patrick and how you do this. You need a spec for events.
00:22:46 [W] Thank you cncf serverless working group for the cloudevents spec and then you need apis and that's where you know kubenetes also comes to the rescue, right?
00:23:00 [W] So that's it.
00:23:01 [W] Thank you so much. Again Sebastian here. You can find me on Twitter at said Goa ping me if you want to, you know, get a deeper dive into trigger meshmark.
00:23:37 [W] Hey everyone. Thanks for listening.
00:23:39 [W] I don't know if you can hear me.
00:23:40 [W] But yes, I'm live. And if you have any questions, please let me know.
00:23:48 [W] I'm here.
00:23:49 [W] all yours.
00:23:53 [W] I do a lot of work with O'Reilly. So I'm used to being in front of a screen with no not seeing anyone right? So here we have okay, so I just need to figure out how do I click?
00:24:06 [W] Thank you private provision says nice presentation.
00:24:11 [W] Thank you very much private.
00:24:12 [W] Thank you.
00:24:13 [W] Hope you liked it.
00:24:14 [W] it. Hope it was informative.
00:24:17 [W] Thanks for the feedback.
00:24:21 [W] There's still a lot of you still connected.
00:24:23 [W] I'm sure you have any questions who is using who is going serverless already. And what are you doing with it?
00:24:32 [W] Let me know.
00:24:33 [W] Ah, okay question.
00:24:36 [W] Okay, maybe whoa.
00:24:37 [W] Okay, there's lots of maybe there is delay with the question bunch of them just showed up.
00:24:41 [W] So achilleas.
00:24:44 [W] Oh, I guess he's from Greece given it is we should say it with the accent great presentation regarding the definition of serverless.
00:24:52 [W] Of you still connected.
00:24:38 [W] I'm sure you have any questions who is using who is going serverless already and what are you doing with it?
00:24:47 [W] Let me know.
00:24:48 [W] Ah, okay question.
00:24:51 [W] Okay, maybe whoa. Okay, there's lots of maybe there is delay with the question bunch of them just showed up.
00:24:55 [W] So achilleas.
00:24:59 [W] Oh, I guess he's from Greece given it is we should say it with the accent great presentation regarding the definition of serverless.
00:25:07 [W] I agree that service rule seems more relevant.
00:25:09 [W] However, thinking of a client-server system, there is no server always alive waiting for we Quest
00:25:20 [W] Yeah, there is well see that's because you know, you're thinking serverless and right away you think function all right.
00:25:29 [W] You think you think function as a service solution fast like Lambda like Cloud run and so on and this system the scaled down to zero, right? So if there are no requests being made there is nothing serving those but there is something that's
00:25:44 [W] Function.
00:25:46 [W] All right, you think you think function as a service solution fast like Lambda like Cloud run and so on and this system the scaled down to zero, right? So if there are no requests being made there is nothing serving those but there is
00:26:01 [W] The function to serve the request at some point.
00:26:05 [W] So yes, if you think you know, if you think in terms of function then yes this scale down to zero so there is no server at one point because the scale down to zero but in truth there is right
00:26:20 [W] how to get started with contributing to open source project
00:26:24 [W] Get to GitHub get up.com / trigger meshmark up.com / kubenetes get up.com cncf. Learn GitHub and start making pull request.
00:26:39 [W] Is trigger measures service meshmark Yvette's so we're not a servicemeshcon the sense of envoi right and voice and servicemeshcon incurred e + y + and so on but we definitely allow people to build event driven applications.
00:26:53 [W] So that means that we are an event meshmark have started talking about event meshmark s'more like this right share a tip.
00:27:02 [W] Thank you, sir.
00:27:03 [W] Thanks for joining.
00:27:04 [W] Josh.
00:27:07 [W] Josh is staying what?
00:27:09 [W] Your thoughts on serverless versus containers.
00:27:12 [W] Well, you know, that's it's one of those things where you know, people are trying to create controversy and fights between each other Technologies.
00:27:21 [W] But the thing is that if you think serverless has been offered by a cloud like AWS and Google you don't know how to do things.
00:27:31 [W] Right? So you don't you don't care if they're using containers or Not Right But if you're trying to provide a serverless experience, and especially if you think in terms of fast, if you're trying to provide a fast experience
00:27:46 [W] Own company, right?
00:27:43 [W] How are you going to do this and that's where containers are going to be very helpful because containers are just packaging mechanism to deliver code. So it's not serverless versus containers.
00:27:55 [W] That's that's totally wrong debate.
00:27:57 [W] Right container is just a technology that can be extremely useful to do bunch of things including providing a serverless experience. Right Reggie. Thank you for the question. Could you
00:28:11 [W] Liber8 a bit more difference about devops and devops. Well, the main idea here is that, you know, ten years ago when when people were struggling with gaining speed with with delivering applications
00:28:26 [W] They started sharing practices best practices on how to how to do development and how to do operations and break down silos so that you know Dave's were not throwing jars over the fence and letting
00:28:30 [W] Letting people do things right?
00:28:25 [W] So that's how devops, you know got got set up.
00:28:28 [W] And now when you when you think about serverless where you're like, you know what I don't want to manage the infrastructure.
00:28:33 [W] I want to use a cloud.
00:28:34 [W] These guys are doing a great job.
00:28:35 [W] So it's somebody else's managing the infrastructure.
00:28:39 [W] So now you actually have to think about managing application developing the apps and really managing the app versus managing the infrastructure.
00:28:48 [W] so that's when it becomes devops.
00:28:50 [W] but you know, just another terminal grpc.
00:28:53 [W] G to say that, you know, we becoming more and more application Centric what is an example of Salesforce to back-office integration while a lot of people use Salesforce, you know CRM, all the information is in cell.
00:29:13 [W] In your in your back office.
00:29:14 [W] How do you think up the entries in the database with what sin sin is in Salesforce?
00:29:19 [W] Right.
00:29:20 [W] So you need to get all the events from Salesforce and then sync with your with your database.
00:29:26 [W] All right, Eric.
00:29:29 [W] Am I at the right place for questions?
00:29:31 [W] you are.
00:29:32 [W] You just ask one and I think I went through almost everything.
00:29:43 [W] Yeah anymore.
00:29:44 [W] I think we almost we almost at the end of time.
00:29:49 [W] or
00:29:50 [W] yeah, go to to - Cube Khan - serverless on the cncf slack.
00:29:57 [W] I'm getting a pop up.
00:29:59 [W] So I minikube Con serverless on slack. You can find me there in the cncf slack.
00:30:05 [W] You can find me in the community slack as well set Goa SCB GOI. You can find me on Twitter a CB G OE, right and
00:30:18 [W] Yeah, thanks a lot for coming have a look at trigger meshmark up get up that comes - trigger meshmark.
00:30:24 [W] com.
00:30:25 [W] We have a brand new website.
00:30:27 [W] We just went G A this week and cloudevents rigor measured at I/O are wonderful SAS building with amazing technology powerful.
00:30:37 [W] Cri-o is backing it and it allows you to build service full applications.
00:30:48 [W] All right.
00:30:54 [W] I think we're good.
00:30:56 [W] So thank you so much everybody and have a good conference.
