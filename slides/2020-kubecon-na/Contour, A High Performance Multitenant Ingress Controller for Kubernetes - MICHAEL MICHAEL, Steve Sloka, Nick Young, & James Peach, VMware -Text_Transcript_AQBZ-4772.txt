00:00:00 [W] Everybody and welcome to our presentation today.
00:00:03 [W] We will be talking about Contour a high-performance multi-tenant Ingress controller for kubernative first.
00:00:10 [W] Let's go ahead and introduce the team that's working on Contour.
00:00:15 [W] Like management at VMware as part of our team but not present here is Steve Kris staff engineer at VMware tonglu the engineering manager also at VMware and I'm going to pass the Baton to Nick.
00:00:32 [W] All right.
00:00:35 [W] Go ahead and I'm unique.
00:00:36 [W] Hi everyone.
00:00:38 [W] I'm Nick Young.
00:00:39 [W] I'm a Teddy on the technical lead for control.
00:00:41 [W] I'm a Staff men engineer at VN way and I am in charge of all the overall direction and architecture of
00:00:52 [W] Hi everyone. I'm Steve sloka.
00:00:54 [W] I'm a senior member of technical staff. Who have you Mark. I work a lot on the envoy Integrations to Contour.
00:01:01 [W] Hi everyone.
00:01:02 [W] I'm James page.
00:01:03 [W] I'm a Staff engineer at VMware have been working on contour for about a year and I contribute in most of the different areas.
00:01:12 [W] Go thank you all and we have our slack channels IDs on the bottom.
00:01:18 [W] So if you need to reach us for all available on the kubernative slack Channel as well.
00:01:22 [W] So let's take a look at what Contour is today. So Contour is an open source communities in Cruise controller and it's providing a control plane for the invoice.
00:01:32 [W] Hm service proxy will really aimed with a mission to be the best singers controller for kubernative and lately we've been accepted into their cncf.
00:01:42 [W] plan to kind of bring together at all of the cloud native Community within the cncf landscape and deliver an amazing Ingress controller that meets your needs we support Dynamic configuration updates and multi-team Ingress delegation out of the box while
00:01:38 [W] Lightweight profile and I'm going to switch over to nyang our technical lead to go through some of the highlights of Contour.
00:01:33 [W] Everyone so yeah control was started in September 2017 and fifty.
00:01:40 [W] Oh, it was started by Dave journey and six local the original members of the team and and at the time Contour was aiming to be a high performance.
00:01:49 [W] Michael said Contours are aiming to be a high-performance Ingress controller with a focus on multi-tenancy Simplicity and being able to Source your Ingress concrete from whatever object you need whether that's English.
00:02:03 [W] HTTP proxy CID or the new service a POS a really key part of Contours philosophy and goals. All along has been to really keep the Unix philosophy in mind that can be a tool that doesn't want thing well and that thing is English
00:02:18 [W] The and being able to Source your Ingress concrete from whatever object you need. Whether that's Ingress HTTP proxy say are they all the new service that he is a really key part of Contours philosophy and goals. All along has been to really keep the Unix philosophy
00:02:52 [W] And so we've worked really hard on converter. I've been on here since for about just over a year and a half now, I think and the we released version 1.0 last year
00:03:07 [W] 19 and yet as we kept going we've as Michael said we've been donated to the cncf minikube ocean level and July which was amazing really great really glad to be a part of that.
00:03:22 [W] And we've learned about we've recently released version 110 which has a bunch of new tools and features which will go into later. But yeah, we're really excited to be a part of this project has been a great journey for me
00:03:34 [W] Work on and they lead to a open source project like this and I'm really looking forward to where we go next.
00:03:43 [W] So I'm going to walk through a quick architecture over gram or overview of how Contour is is implemented and deployed as you'll see here.
00:03:51 [W] We've got traffic from the internet which comes in from outside your cluster it targets. Typically a load balancer its load balancers job is to send traffic to a fleet of envoy is running in your cluster.
00:04:01 [W] So contrary uses Envoy as its data path component. So all traffic routes through Envoy Envoy is another cncf project. And again, it's the it's the reverse proxy that contrary implements so contrary actually in this
00:04:13 [W] Texture is the configuration server for Envoy.
00:04:16 [W] So it implements envoys XDS server.
00:04:19 [W] So Contours job is to watch the cluster for things like services and points Ingress objects and secrets when it sees any of those things change Contour then builds a new configuration in memory and streams is changes down to Envoy Envoy then can take those
00:04:34 [W] Russian server for Envoy so it implements envoys XDS server.
00:04:35 [W] So Contours job is to watch the cluster for things like services and points Ingress objects and secrets when it sees any of those things change Contour then builds a new configuration in memory and streams as changes down to Envoy Envoy. Then can take those
00:04:59 [W] And then serve traffic properly within your cluster. So again, the traffic comes in from the internet hits load balancer routes through Envoy and then to your back end applications.
00:05:12 [W] Thank you, Steve, and we're going to see a demo later on of some of the Next Generation work on Contour here.
00:05:18 [W] So let's switch over and talk about some of the latest developments in Contour. So James you got the Baton.
00:05:25 [W] Thanks Michael. So as Mike pointed out we've done maybe ten releases in the last year.
00:05:32 [W] So we're actually adding features quite frequently some of the things we were working on recently. The big one is external authorization support, which we'll talk
00:05:41 [W] But in more detail soon, we've also added cause support which is really useful for anyone doing web applications or single page apps in JavaScript.
00:05:52 [W] We're working on Envoy XDS V3 support So Envoy has done a major new version of its API and we're taking full advantage of that.
00:06:05 [W] We will also one of the things we've been doing, you know as the over number of releases kind of improve the integration of Contour with other projects in the ecosystem.
00:06:15 [W] So load balancer IP status is one of the features in that area.
00:06:20 [W] In your arm Platforms in the cloud and TLS client certificate validation.
00:06:27 [W] There's another there's a project in the Contour ecosystem called net Contour which allows k- serving.
00:06:34 [W] Do you use contour for its Ingress support?
00:06:36 [W] And finally we're working on a contour operator, which will make it easy to deploy contour and Envoy and also to have multiple Contour deployments.
00:06:50 [W] Can you go to the next slide Michael?
00:06:54 [W] say excellent authorization is one of the earliest user requested features for contour and what people want here is a way for the platform and the Contour deployment to provide a single authorization mechanism
00:07:09 [W] You and authenticate users and means that individual applications don't have to worry about implementing it so you can get a consistent authorization experience across all your applications in the cluster so you can you can
00:07:18 [W] All your applications in the cluster.
00:07:11 [W] So you can you can lot of clock.
00:07:14 [W] Excuse me.
00:07:15 [W] So some people will use a YDC some people will use ldap. But basically as far as Contour is concerned, it doesn't matter what you do.
00:07:23 [W] We you can build your own server and do your own custom authorization mechanism, or you can pull one from the broader Envoy ecosystem. For example, is geosoft service can be used with contour and everything will work fine.
00:07:45 [W] The general architecture for authentication is shown here in this diagram.
00:07:50 [W] So it client will do a get request to Envoy and there is a extension service ci/cd, which the operator has already deployed the extension service CID represents a binding between
00:08:06 [W] and a external authorization service Contour will configure Envoy to send requests to the external authorization service on every request that comes from the client the external authorization service will
00:08:20 [W] either accept or reject the request and if it rejects the request it can redirect the client in order so that the client can obtain any kind of authorization formation that it needs then when the client Returns the
00:08:29 [W] Will authorize it request and will forward it to the Upstream service.
00:08:33 [W] Thank you James.
00:08:34 [W] So let's take a look at all of this in action. And a lot of exciting work has gone into enabling external authorization in to contour and is actually one of the highest requested features for Contours.
00:08:45 [W] So next I'm going to stop my sharing here and Steve slug is going to share his screen and walk you through what it looks like in real life Steve cool. Hey, thanks. Michael Thanks James for that intro.
00:08:57 [W] So here we're going to walk through actually implementing what James is described there on the screen. So what I have here is I
00:09:03 [W] Got a cluster running and I have Contour deployed to it.
00:09:06 [W] So what I can do is I can go ahead and get.
00:09:10 [W] So you all the HTTP proxies that have in my cluster?
00:09:14 [W] So here I've got three of them, right and this is a typical site that you might see, you know, and your clusters. So my domain name here is Steve slow productive, and I've got a TLS secret on here and that comes from let's encrypt the assert manager.
00:09:25 [W] So these are all let's encrypt certificates that are dynamically configured. So this a couple other proxies here for the marketing team in the blog sites, but we won't worry about that for this demo at least. So just to prove that this works we can come into here and let's go ahead.
00:09:41 [W] Check out the site and what you'll see here is it's got a simple Act of server here.
00:09:44 [W] So this tells you that hey, this is the default site.
00:09:47 [W] Here's the request and here's the headers.
00:09:49 [W] We're going to do again.
00:09:48 [W] This is the same diagram and change just talked about is we're gonna go ahead and deploy some prerequisite prerequisite bits to deploy this external off service. Again, it's something that we deploy in the cluster.
00:09:58 [W] So first we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and deploy a namespace for all of these we're going to put all of this stuff into this namespace called project Contour off in the namespace.
00:10:07 [W] We're going to create a service account and this is going to be used for our authorization server to be able to look for secrets in the cluster. It's going to use these secrets to be able to
00:10:16 [W] Pull out passwords and this demo we're going to use basic passwords are basic password off, which is very simple, but you know, we can extend it to other types as James mentioned.
00:10:26 [W] So once we have this cluster will create a binding and then we'll also create a quick little cluster issuer here. This is going to let us create some self-signed certificates for the AWS service inside the cluster so that communication between Envoy in the services all is secured.
00:10:42 [W] Let's go ahead and apply this first bin.
00:10:45 [W] So we'll send this one over.
00:10:47 [W] All right, so then created all those so now we should have a name space.
00:10:54 [W] Called project Contour off down here.
00:10:55 [W] You can see it's seven seconds old.
00:10:57 [W] Alright, so next we're going to deploy our actual off server and that's again that's this external officer was a bit right here.
00:11:03 [W] So this this is here.
00:11:05 [W] Here's our service we're going to use for it. It's called HD password and then here's the deployment.
00:11:10 [W] Project that Contour the Contour team has out in its Contour repo.
00:11:02 [W] So there's a couple different off servers that we provide for you.
00:11:05 [W] There's a simple one that's used for unit testing.
00:11:07 [W] and then this one's used for basic auth.
00:11:10 [W] So this is again, this is we're going to demo today with HD password.
00:11:12 [W] So the image here, this is V 2 we're going to run the HT password a server over Port 944 3 and will reference some secrets are certificates that come from Secrets. You'll see those Secrets or volume didn't hear through the passwords.
00:11:25 [W] There's the source of the secret here is going to come from this too.
00:11:29 [W] Difficuit so in the previous step. We created that self-signed cluster issuer for certain manager here actually going to request the password from certain manager or request a certificate.
00:11:38 [W] Sorry so we can secure that communication.
00:11:40 [W] Let's go ahead and apply this then.
00:11:46 [W] Okay, so create the service the deployment and the certificate so if we go ahead and get pods and then a Space Project Contour off what you'll see here is I have this off server now running similarly.
00:11:58 [W] should have a secret.
00:12:00 [W] And there and it's called HD password again that matches the certificate a requested and you can see that one's 14 seconds old.
00:12:07 [W] Okay, so back to our diagram here.
00:12:08 [W] We've got this off server bit deployed.
00:12:10 [W] Next we're gonna go ahead and deploy some secrets for this.
00:12:15 [W] It's difficuit.
00:11:50 [W] So if we go ahead and get pods and then a Space Project Contour off what you'll see here is I have this off server now running.
00:11:59 [W] Similarly. I should have a secret.
00:12:02 [W] And there and it's called HD password again that matches the certificate a requested and you can see that one's 14 seconds old.
00:12:09 [W] Okay, so back to our diagram here.
00:12:10 [W] We've got this author bit deployed next.
00:12:13 [W] We're going to go ahead and deploy some secrets for this.
00:12:16 [W] So what we need is some sort of user database.
00:12:18 [W] So in here this secret has its and it's kind of its basic C 4 encoded but what they see password, we actually created a user called user one with password called password one and we created user to and use your three and that's all done up
00:12:53 [W] And we create a user to and user 3 and that's all done up front here in this secret.
00:12:57 [W] So whenever the officer responds up its going to look for the secret and then use it to become the source source user base for our users to login.
00:13:06 [W] login. So what kind of apply this one?
00:13:10 [W] Okay.
00:13:11 [W] So now we have that next we're going to create this extension service and again back to our diagram here.
00:13:16 [W] We have this bit all deployed now.
00:13:18 [W] So now we're going to take this extension service again, as James mentioned the goal of this is to help integrate this ah service into our Contour infrastructure.
00:13:24 [W] So now we can reference this.
00:13:27 [W] ah service from our HTTP proxy.
00:13:29 [W] So if you look at this again, this is called extension service and we're going to reference this service we created in Step 2 here this deployment. So HD password is the service of our off server again deployed here.
00:13:40 [W] In this Orange Box, let's go ahead and create this.
00:13:51 [W] Okay.
00:13:52 [W] So now we have our extension service created.
00:13:54 [W] Finally, that's all the bits now.
00:13:56 [W] We just have to tell our HTTP proxy that we want to turn off on right then. We'll do that here.
00:14:01 [W] So this is that route proxy that we saw it originally and we're gonna do is we're going to add these little bits here.
00:14:07 [W] So this authorization that now within the virtual host. Lets us reference an extension service.
00:14:17 [W] Okay. So now we have our extension service created.
00:14:20 [W] Finally, that's all the bits now.
00:14:22 [W] We just have to tell our HTTP proxy that we want to turn off on right then.
00:14:26 [W] We'll do that here.
00:14:27 [W] So this is that route proxy that we saw originally and we're going to is we're going to add these little bits here.
00:14:32 [W] So this authorization bit now within the virtual host. Lets us reference an extension service.
00:14:38 [W] So here you can see referencing this HT password again that was created in this step four here and it's the namespace project Contour off. So now once we apply this Contour will then tell Envoy that our new requests
00:14:50 [W] It's coming in. We want to have this authorized. So Envoy will then forward this request out to our office server. Also, we will basically do a thumbs up or thumbs down depending on what it receives and then the request will either be denied or it will be allowed through into your into your application.
00:15:18 [W] For this request out to our off server.
00:15:21 [W] Also, we will basically do a thumbs up or thumbs down depending on what it receives and then the request will either be denied or it will be allowed through into your into your application.
00:15:28 [W] go ahead and apply this one.
00:15:37 [W] Okay, so we can figure out our route real quick. We can check for errors.
00:15:40 [W] So we'll get our proxies again.
00:15:42 [W] You see we have no errors here based on the status information.
00:15:45 [W] So what we can do now is we'll go ahead and curl for this. So we'll do a quick curl for / secure and you'll see that I get a 4-1 redirect here.
00:15:56 [W] So as for one response tells me that I'm not authenticated because I haven't passed any users in so again based on our authorization flow.
00:16:03 [W] I'm not allowed to come in. But if we grab the second one here, and we actually pass a user.
00:16:07 [W] So use your one with password one now the see the request comes through right the only downside to what we've done here is that the secure path has security which is what we want, but the other one doesn't either so it looks like
00:16:22 [W] Have the second one here, and we actually pass a user.
00:16:24 [W] So use your one with password one. Now the see the request comes through right the only downside to what we've done here is that the secure path has security which is what we want, but the other one doesn't either so it looks like I already
00:16:40 [W] So what we've done is in your routes, you can apply some off conditions and from here. You can say I can disable my off policy. So what you see is on the
00:16:55 [W] on this hashicorp we have off but if I hit slash Dev or / I still get the 401 so we'll do is we'll go ahead and apply this auth policy to our route which basically will allow our
00:17:09 [W] Root path, which is / to not require authorization.
00:17:12 [W] So we'll save that.
00:17:17 [W] It will apply the root again.
00:17:19 [W] cool.
00:17:20 [W] So now when I curl for the route, I don't have am not required to have authorization.
00:17:26 [W] But if I add size secure you can see now that is secured. So I'm required to login before I do anything there.
00:17:33 [W] So that's a good a good quick overview of authorization in Contour.
00:17:38 [W] There is a nice guide out here on a contra website. I've looking for more information which walks you through what we just talked about also with some some flow diagrams and everything to help explain this a little better.
00:17:47 [W] That's all I have back to you Michael.
00:17:50 [W] Absolutely.
00:17:51 [W] Thank you Steve and thank you Tim for for working on this and obviously as you are users want to implement your own authorization providers and extensions into Contour coming to the control Channel talk show up in our community meetings and office hours and tell us what it is that you're building might be able to redirect you to an
00:18:06 [W] Or help you out.
00:18:06 [W] So we're here to make sure that you are successful with your Ingress needs.
00:18:13 [W] Next I'm going to switch to to Nikki and who's going to talk to you about the roadmap and where we're going.
00:18:21 [W] Everyone again, so yeah, we're obviously as a public open source project.
00:18:26 [W] We have a public road map first artists with their public road map, but I probably should say this is a this is our current directions based on our current priorities.
00:18:37 [W] This is an open road map. So it's really open for you to come and say hey, I really need this thing straight away, and I want to build it or I really need this thing very urgently and I need you to do it, you know, if you need either of those things, please come.
00:18:49 [W] Focus your this roadmap is not set in stone.
00:18:52 [W] It's a living document and we're content where they're up to change it if with with the reason our that said this the current things that are on this slide are some of the things that were scheduled to do by the end of this hopefully by the end of this calendar year.
00:19:07 [W] the first one is a relative thing that's being able to plug an external service for rate-limiting in a similar way to what we did with the external off so that you can rate limit rate.
00:19:19 [W] Our current parties.
00:19:03 [W] This is an open road map.
00:19:04 [W] So it's really open for you to come and say hey, I really need this thing straight away and I want to build it or I really need this thing very urgently and I need you to do it, you know, if you need either of those things, please come and talk to us this roadmap is not set in stone.
00:19:17 [W] It's a living document and we're content where we're up to change it if with with the reason however that said this the current things that are on this slide are some of the things that were scheduled to do by the end of this hopefully by the end of this calendar,
00:19:30 [W] The year, so the first one is a relative thing that's being able to plug an external service for rate limiting in the similar way to what we did with the external off so that you can rate limit rate limit
00:21:24 [W] Needed which was that extension service ci/cd.
00:21:28 [W] Also we're looking for some we're hoping to get some more deployment support done by the end of the year.
00:21:34 [W] So right now we've got projects working running to create an operator and to have an official Helm chart for Comfort.
00:21:43 [W] There is a currently an artificial one and we're working to build bring that one and make it official and the purposes of both of those are to just make it easier to get Contour installed but also to
00:21:54 [W] Make it easier to install Contour in a variety of scenarios. Currently our install method is that we provide you with an example deployment that will get you up and running but you then we can't do it because it's applied
00:22:09 [W] Variety of scenarios currently our install method is that we provide you with an example the point that will get you up and running but you then we can't do it because it's applied as a series of the animals.
00:22:22 [W] There's no way for us to give you options. And so both of those things are in a way for us to give you options the third one. The third one here is a bit more complicated to explain we've historically when the project started we were a very small team new
00:22:37 [W] what kind of to explain we've historically when the project started we were very small team to than three people when I joined and you we had a lot of features that we needed to build and so we need to stay focused on the ones that were the most important
00:22:52 [W] That you we didn't put my focus on at the time was the configurability.
00:22:56 [W] I think we all missed to begin with the the real importance of for a centralized property team of being able to tweak whole bunch of options about your requests timeouts and a bunch of other details
00:23:11 [W] Of options about your requests timeouts and a bunch of other details.
00:23:13 [W] And so since since I've become particularly, one of the focuses of for me has been really opening up that and finding sustainable ways to allow people to configure all those things about I'm worried that you need to configure in a centralized
00:23:28 [W] Happen allows you to in the past and so we're really hoping to close out this in-toto to put to sort of make adding new Envoy config.
00:23:37 [W] Just be a you and something that we do you all the time it is done in a relatively standard way.
00:23:42 [W] So that is what the sort of that this roadmap item means. The last one. I'm probably one of the most exciting ones for the future of Contour is service API support So service the service apis are project of community Sig Network that is
00:23:57 [W] He's done in a relatively standard way.
00:23:58 [W] So that is what the sort of that this prodyna bottom means.
00:24:01 [W] The last one.
00:24:03 [W] I'm probably one of the most exciting ones for the future of Contour is service API support So service the service apis are project of community Sig Network that is about building a new set of apis describe
00:24:39 [W] New set of apis describe Services inside the cluster and how they get traffic how you get traffic to the from outside. The cost of that is it's kind of a replacement plus more for both Ingress and the
00:24:54 [W] Having two identities right now.
00:24:55 [W] It's huge project with huge scope that we need to come up. And so you if you're more interested in this I'd certainly encourage you to get involved in the project.
00:25:06 [W] There's you there's a lot of work to do but yet one full Contour the thing that we will be want to look at doing is making sure that we once the service apis are actually released we are able to take those objects for
00:25:21 [W] In the same way that we can currently take Ingress objects or eight our nation haproxy ci/cd and the bit exciting part. There is that this is this is going to be eventually the new way that that we can figure this Ingress
00:25:34 [W] For the foreseeable future, but this is going to be the way that you get all the the Nifty bells and whistles. That is very hard to do English V1.
00:25:36 [W] So yeah, that's that's most of the the our roadmap for the end of the year.
00:25:40 [W] And we've got a few there's a few other sort of Maintenance things that are on there by the end of the year. The big one is as Michael said earlier that XD sv3 change that ex DSP 2 for the support and fire from Envoy at the end of the year.
00:25:54 [W] So that's really important.
00:25:55 [W] finish that one be at that. There's a probably the biggest thing.
00:25:58 [W] In for until the end of this calendar year further out than that that we do have a few things on the list, but you room apps free open and on please come and talk to us about other features that you want and then I'll hand back to Michael too.
00:26:13 [W] Thank you. Thank unique. So we've taken a lot of time so far talking about what's going on in contour and from a technical standpoint in some of our features, but you know, we want you to come and help us shave what Contour looks like tomorrow
00:26:28 [W] Brand Community. We have multiple ways that you can engage with us.
00:26:30 [W] You know, I'm going to go through some of them right now.
00:26:33 [W] So we're on the kubernative slack under the hashtag Contour Channel.
00:26:37 [W] We have a mailing list where you can get updates about the project new releases and also ask questions.
00:26:43 [W] You can interact with us on Twitter and the project Contour. We have our GitHub repos where you can come and see all the work that's happening in real time in contour. And we also have a playlist of on YouTube of all the canonical
00:26:56 [W] Knative meetings and you have so if you want to know about something that happened in the past or miss the meeting go ahead and do that.
00:27:02 [W] Overall. The control Community is super vibrant or ecosystem is is super engaging we're welcoming to new users.
00:27:11 [W] But let's go through some of the projects that this takes. We have two and a half thousand GitHub stars. And that number is growing 430 contributors 400 Forks five maintainers 55 releases since we started a hundred thirty contributing componentconfig.
00:27:27 [W] 731 select members and more blogs cubic on talks Twitter followers.
00:27:32 [W] We want you to be part of this community come and help us deliver control. We have about 10 minutes left for Q&A.
00:27:38 [W] So feel free to ask anything that's near and dear to your heart. Thank you all from the control community.
00:27:45 [W] Thanks everybody.
00:27:54 [W] Hello.
00:27:55 [W] Jay
00:28:01 [W] Sorry, Michael.
00:28:02 [W] I didn't hear that.
00:28:06 [W] To answer some of the authorization questions that were posted, please sure.
00:28:13 [W] Let's have a look at some of those.
00:28:17 [W] Let's see. Meow. Meow.
00:28:21 [W] I apologize. If my pronunciation is terrible can Contour refer to an external officer the server outside of Kate's so the we still server.
00:28:36 [W] So the external service CID can refer can throw the
00:28:43 [W] It can sub can refer to an external nameservers. So yes, you can.
00:28:53 [W] I'm in deep Singapore asks, how is the CID linked with your server?
00:28:59 [W] How that's linked directly and then in a HTTP proxy object. When you define your virtual host, that's when you refer to the extension service so you can mix and match these things pretty arbitrarily so
00:28:57 [W] Three or four different extension services which represent different Earth servers so you can have like an oid C1 a basic with one and ldap one various custom things and then you can apply them to different virtual hosts depending on the
00:29:12 [W] of that virtual host
00:29:13 [W] Shaquille Maja T asks about documentation. So project contoured cri-o.
00:29:42 [W] And in case we run out of time, which seems to be in any minute now, please come to us on the hashtag Contour channel in the kubernative slack and we can answer any and all of your questions. There will also be around
00:29:57 [W] To keep compe maintain a channel on kubenetes like just after this but there are a couple of ones that I can probably address now the so there's a few I think I'll hit
00:30:11 [W] Once I'm what does multi-tenancy mean in this context?
00:30:08 [W] That means you've got lots of different consumers of your Ingress running in the same cluster.
00:30:14 [W] That's all that's all we're talking about there. Now. That was sorry that was based on Kim.
00:30:20 [W] Thanks for that one.
00:30:20 [W] I think we've got we've got a couple of questions here about performance. And yeah and what Contours for one from says what isil and one
00:30:34 [W] From sod will shake. I think we I think the main thing that we're looking to do here is we Contra is it to be a high-performance controller and we because we use Envoy.
00:30:49 [W] I'm in the way Envoy works.
00:30:50 [W] Is it Envoy has a separate data plane and you have the control plane.
00:30:56 [W] not in line with the data plane so you can make changes to the config and restart the Contour deployment without
00:31:04 [W] Having the envoy injured and that's your data plan interrupted.
00:31:09 [W] That's one of the advantages that any Envoy solution has over the defaulting goodness in nginx English controller.
00:31:17 [W] I'm not a hundred percent up on the latest performance numbers for for Envoy versus nginx, but it will be yo, whatever they are is basically the answer there. I think one other
00:31:32 [W] It is that Contour is currently a layer 7 English controller. So for side mentioned about Telco applications, if you're talking about anything you about stuff that's not mainly HTTP or https traffic then
00:31:45 [W] Is it has sort of has minimal support for that sort of thing at the moment and there's no support for UDP.
00:31:37 [W] So and then there's a couple is another one here from bow.
00:31:45 [W] Go again.
00:31:46 [W] Yeah, a contoured does support multiple instances of on Wade basically by having multiple deployments of Contour you if that's if you want to break your Ingress apart if you want to have multiple instances of envoy for a chain, that's
00:32:01 [W] We recommend deploying Contour.
00:32:02 [W] I think and the there's another one by from Bhaskar Reddy.
00:32:07 [W] How is Contour English control of different from the sto English Gateway Contour doesn't require using SEO but aside from that it's quite similar in function to the
00:32:22 [W] Give the probably an argument to make that if you're using this to you you I'd start with the sto Ingress K way rather than anything else.
00:32:23 [W] I think that's most of the ones that I can see.
00:32:28 [W] I'd sorry Lucas asks is the outer box support for oauth 2 and O ATC James
00:32:37 [W] Yeah, so so Contour supports the envoy grpc EXT off protocol. So the idea there is we're not doing we we didn't want to do anything Contours specific.
00:32:49 [W] You don't have to write an officer with it's like specifically only going to work with Contour where we're going to work with anything that's available in the broader Envoy ecosystem.
00:32:59 [W] So we don't have an oid see Server that's kind of specifically hosted within the Contour.
00:33:06 [W] What we've written specifically for Contour, there's one that in the Estuary ecosystem.
00:33:14 [W] I added a link there ich sto ecosystem slash auth service.
00:33:20 [W] That's a good one to try.
00:33:21 [W] I think anything that's available for ORD see in general will work for you.
00:33:36 [W] tenant
00:33:41 [W] So I love asks does contour a great with pink feather 8.
00:33:46 [W] I don't know what pink Federate is.
00:33:49 [W] Can anyone enlighten me? Yeah, it's a it's an IDC for a provider kind of like AWS 0 I think so, I think depending on the protocol you want to connect with then?
00:34:00 [W] then? Yeah, Contour should work like James mentioned we have the plumbing the communicate the connect contour and
00:34:07 [W] Arthritis together but it's up to that middle middle layer to actually implement the whatever back-end protocol you're going to our back-end system.
00:34:13 [W] You're going to implement to so yeah in theory it should so.
00:34:16 [W] Yeah, if it's a standard or DC provider then probably the East your ecosystem will service would work with it.
00:34:25 [W] I'm there.
00:34:28 [W] I know people who have written a thin grpc Envoy grpc stub that works with Dex so
00:34:36 [W] So yeah, these things are pretty easy to do.
00:34:48 [W] I think we are almost out of time and it looks like questions have slowed.
00:34:53 [W] The kubernative slack we stay in Contour on the community slack all the time.
00:34:48 [W] So questions there we will get to if when not watching key notes or something in the next couple of days.
00:34:55 [W] But yeah, we should be there all the time, please.
00:34:58 [W] Yeah, feel free to reach out to us.
00:35:01 [W] Anyway there or if you have feature requests or other stuff, please feel free to log and issue on GitHub or talk to us there. Is there anything else anyone else would like to say I think we're pretty much out of time.
00:35:15 [W] Thanks everyone for coming to our talk and asking questions.
00:35:18 [W] It's been great.
00:35:18 [W] Yeah has been great.
00:35:20 [W] Thanks for so many questions.
