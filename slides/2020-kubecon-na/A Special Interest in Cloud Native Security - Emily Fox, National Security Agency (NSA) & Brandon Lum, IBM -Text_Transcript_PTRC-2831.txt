00:00:00 [W] Hello everyone, and thank you so much for joining Brandon and eyes introduction to Cloud native security.
00:00:06 [W] already what we do and we are and why we're amazing then Brandon is going to jump in with some excellent resources for you to dig into later and even talk about some things are going to make your lives and the cognitive security communities lives better
00:00:21 [W] Things up with how you can get involved with the Stellar group of folks and help move cloudiness in curity forward.
00:00:19 [W] Here we go, the mission of the special interest group for security in the cloud knative computing Foundation is to reduce risk that cloudbees of applications Expose and user data or allow other unauthorized access.
00:00:32 [W] Everyone wants to protect their data and only allow authorized users access to Applications.
00:00:38 [W] We're here to help make that possible in the community. We have three
00:00:43 [W] primary focus areas ensuring the protection of cloudiness assistance while providing the needed access to authorized users and services establishing a common understanding and common tooling to help developers meet security requirements and promote come
00:00:58 [W] That possible in the community. We have three primary focus areas ensuring the protection of cloudiness systems while providing the needed access to authorized users and services establishing a common understanding and common tooling to
00:01:28 [W] for audit and reasoning about system properties and we do this through a lot of great opportunities within the Sig to include some major projects that we have underway or wrapping up our cognitive security white paper and
00:01:43 [W] You are hearing this. It will be published in LinkedIn our repo the white paper is designed to be a guide to your first cloudbees of security architecture. It was developed With Love by this big and its members to help all teams and cognitive be more secure.
00:01:58 [W] Introduced a new model for cognitive security layers as you see in this diagram, it dives into each of these areas and features an executive summary later.
00:02:05 [W] We will be linking various sections with the new version of the cncf landscape, which is coming soon the cloud native security white paper has a lot of excellent content.
00:02:17 [W] So be sure if you're reading through it that you take your time with over 36 pages and a lot of great detail.
00:02:26 [W] Al's we can't wait to get your feedback and help make it that much better.
00:02:31 [W] This thing does a lot to help ensure the security of cloud need of projects while helping to identify projects that push more secure development and deployment as you can see we focused on quite a few different areas from container Registries to Key
00:02:46 [W] General Security and compliance.
00:02:47 [W] It's important to us that the community continue to move forward with Cloud native security and the assessments that we perform on these projects as well as our special projects that we have supply chain help move that forward now
00:03:02 [W] All right.
00:02:58 [W] Thank you Emily.
00:02:59 [W] So as security we have many different activities going on SOS.
00:03:04 [W] And so we're going to go to a couple of these. So first and foremost, we have presentations as discussions these usually happen during our weekly meetings on Wednesdays and these vary from presentations about
00:03:19 [W] As is very from positions about project such as pasta and key lime and other security projects to end user vendor stories and lessons about security.
00:03:27 [W] So on top of that we have several discussions and these topics are brought in by committee members.
00:03:32 [W] So this could be technical where once we talked about the management of rating or cves for cloudbees if projects to discussions about how we can collaborate on certain topics, for example recently members of
00:03:48 [W] Didn't Consortium the CCC came to discuss what they were doing and also explore Avenues to collaborate with parts of the cognitive ecosystem.
00:04:02 [W] So example of a security resource producing material by the group is supply chain catalog.
00:04:08 [W] This is the effort that resulted in a couple interested members in the community and what the security supply chain catalog is really is a provides this of supply chain compromises and descriptions of what
00:04:23 [W] Hi to Supply Chain management.
00:04:21 [W] For example, we talked about a few different ideas.
00:04:26 [W] Like what does it mean for a track called typosquatting what the signing mean in the context of Supply chains?
00:04:33 [W] So the document is meant to provide more both means of education but also serves to help security practitioners convince management and decision makers on the importance of supply chain attacks.
00:04:49 [W] So as I mentioned earlier, this is community managed. So if this is something that you're interested in a you see a new supply chain compromise, I would like to add more information about the tracks and mitigations. Please do come by and create a peer.
00:05:08 [W] So transitioning on top of the weekly meetings and when we don't have a pandemic going on we hold in person events could locate that with Cube Colin Kata knative call and or basically any Securities.
00:05:21 [W] It's called knative conference that we have a problem of members at so as we come to the close of 2020.
00:05:29 [W] We hope that the situation will get better soon. We and I many of you look forward to seeing where we can continue in person meet up safely.
00:05:40 [W] And last but not least.
00:05:42 [W] I want to spend some time on one of our core activities which are security assessments.
00:05:46 [W] Something we do regularly and to date we have completed five security assessments for cncf projects.
00:05:48 [W] These are Harbor spiffe e Spire in-toto Opa and key cook.
00:05:53 [W] So Allah is a security assessment.
00:05:56 [W] So first off just to clarify the term security assessment can be often overloaded.
00:06:04 [W] And so we just want to make it clear that the security assessment is not a security audit.
00:06:11 [W] To us a security assessment is to be able to assess the security posture of a project this includes looking at the goals of the project and evaluating the amount of thought that has been given to the security aspects of the project.
00:06:26 [W] Just from overall architecture and design patterns of the project includes also the evaluation of security processes by the project.
00:06:18 [W] For example, how does the project handle security issues and respond to security incidents?
00:06:26 [W] So the security assessment also helps the sick provide recommendations to the cncf technical oversight committee or the cncf talk for example for projects that are incubating are graduating and
00:06:41 [W] We also provide some feedback for example, and the spiffe e in Spire assessment.
00:06:40 [W] recommended that the project go to a security Audits and it is a critical security component in the cncf ecosystem.
00:06:50 [W] Finally what comes out of the security assessment is a document which will be seeing shortly provides an overview of the project and the security considerations.
00:07:01 [W] So at the end of it, this is a very useful document for both the project as a security door MD type file.
00:07:08 [W] in addition to that for any users who like to use the project and really don't know how to start in terms of security. This document will help guide them in terms of getting solid.
00:07:19 [W] And adapting to technology.
00:07:25 [W] So let's go take a look at an assessment.
00:07:27 [W] So what we have up here is kind of the overview we of what the harbor assessment looks like.
00:07:34 [W] So the security assessment documents. Lots of if you can see details of the project what the goals of the project what does it do and how does it work?
00:07:43 [W] Then we go into details of what the design architecture the project is.
00:07:49 [W] So ends up being a nice encapsulation of most of the details you will need
00:07:54 [W] About project starting from the ground up.
00:07:57 [W] So that's usually consist of several parts including the types of attacks the technical capabilities that could be present as well as for other different threats and mitigations.
00:08:03 [W] So in addition to this security considerations are also discussed here, for example, if a project uses a plug-in or external database what happens if the database on componentconfig mais,
00:08:18 [W] So kind of little bit of high-level track modeling that's happening in this section as well.
00:08:15 [W] So as you can see from this picture, this is actually a screenshot from the harbor assessment as well.
00:08:20 [W] You can see that in this case different components being compromised with the two different levels of risk being exposed.
00:08:27 [W] So this could help inform the decision. If someone was to create a diploid Harbor they would be able to see. Okay looks like my compromise storage back-end really is no risk, so
00:08:43 [W] As much controls as I would have example for a number 18 the compromise for this cash.
00:08:46 [W] So I want to put a lot more controls around read this and then storage back then my storage back-end. For example.
00:08:57 [W] And finally, we cover the implications of the project has in terms of the security of the cognitive ecosystem as well as the security processes of a project. For example, a how does one file a security bug report.
00:09:14 [W] and finally, we cover the implications of the project has in terms of the security of the cognitive ecosystem as well as the security processes of a project for example, a how does one file a security bug report
00:09:50 [W] Of handling that and also the more technical aspects of this, right? So does the project have a deaf seccomp Spire blind other releases of the project sign and house icky stuff, for example
00:10:08 [W] And after the entire review is done.
00:10:10 [W] We create a one-sided summary for the TOC and this covers briefly what the project is as you can see on the left. We have two goals to design security analysis and maturity as well as some recommendations
00:10:25 [W] Cncf as well as for the project.
00:10:27 [W] So in the example we have here.
00:10:30 [W] This was from the OPA assessment and one of the big findings that we had was that is the policy language Rego of we found was difficult to use and sometimes result in mistakes in writing policies.
00:10:42 [W] So for the cncf, we had a recommendation that they should serve a user's of opa to detect if they see any certain patterns of insecurity that may arise in policies.
00:10:56 [W] And for the project room recommended that they improve the documentation as well as work on usability of the policy language.
00:11:05 [W] So there's some sausages of nsmcon.
00:11:07 [W] So if I any of this really interesting to you the good news is that you can volunteer to be a security assessment reviewer.
00:11:16 [W] I'll team of reviewers has grown tremendously over the year, and we've seen a lot of great new faces.
00:11:24 [W] And just in case you're not sold on that yet.
00:11:26 [W] There are many opportunities for professional development as well in participating with these reviewers.
00:11:32 [W] It provides an opportunity to really deep deeply dive into a new cser project or something that you've been always looking at on never really had the chance to look into and
00:11:48 [W] Your process, you know, you have the other reviewers as well as a project maintainers who are there and really engaged in the review in addition to that.
00:11:51 [W] are many networking opportunity. So both for with the other Sig members as well as project maintainers cncf staff.
00:12:02 [W] So awesome.
00:12:03 [W] How do I get solid security assessment done in trip experience?
00:12:08 [W] The expectation is that one was spent a total of 10 hours over these three weeks dedicated to the review.
00:12:15 [W] So if this gets you excited come shout-out on select to us, we currently have a security assessment There is almost ready to go.
00:12:25 [W] This is for cloud native buildpacks. So if you're interested comment on the issue is
00:12:31 [W] well
00:12:34 [W] now here is how you can get involved with this wonderful group of individuals. And I know that you want to check out a repo and join one of our meetings.
00:12:43 [W] We don't require that.
00:12:44 [W] You're a security expert we want you to listen in and learn or maybe if you are present on a security topic we've got over 60 members and we are growing strong, but we always need more passionate people such as yourself to help make our community
00:13:00 [W] Make Cloud native security better to there are lots of things for new members to do. We encourage you to read through the repo familiarizing yourself with who we are what we're working on and how we run things.
00:12:56 [W] We love it when you found MERS our folks join looking to join review our PR s comments on them and prove them submit issues in a proposal or even make a PR to close out an open issue.
00:13:08 [W] We've got some easy ones in there. We have labels for tickets that need help and sometimes just
00:13:13 [W] star quick review is all that's needed.
00:13:16 [W] As Brandon talked about we've got presentations and proposals and suggestions and even security assessments that can all be excellent ways to contribute and grow the community but it just starts by submitting an issue.
00:13:29 [W] You can learn more in our slack Channel Sig - Security in our meetings every Wednesday at 10 a.m.
00:13:36 [W] Pacific and through our mailing list. We look forward to seeing you at our next meeting and saying hi and slack.
00:13:42 [W] Thanks everyone.
00:13:52 [W] Hello everyone never here.
00:13:58 [W] What's are the questions you all have? I know there's over 80 of you out there at one point over 90.
00:14:08 [W] Whoa questions are coming in fast.
00:14:10 [W] So Chris asks, what skills? Would you be looking for and potential security reviewers Brandon.
00:14:19 [W] Do you want to take this one?
00:14:20 [W] Yeah. So I think we for Security review was there are kind of multiple multiple different angles to go about with it.
00:14:33 [W] So I think
00:14:37 [W] Any background in security with the you've been a pen tester with the European Ryder of code? I think usually we have a the review team is a set of people that come from diverse backgrounds.
00:14:50 [W] So it's a if you know, whether you're a builder or whether your breaker the teen generally consists of a good diversity of that and also if we've had several members that came into the sick who
00:15:05 [W] Didn't have not done the security assessment before all kind of starting off and you know, they've they've kind of sat in on the reviews. So usually work in sectionals and they've gone into this discussion the kind of seen how
00:15:14 [W] Refuse so usually work in sectionals and it's gone to this discussion the kind of seeing how things are being done and you know, they still the kind of get the hang of it and then the participating and the future videos.
00:15:29 [W] Yes, definitely Zachary wants to know what if he can't ever make the 10 o'clock meeting time and that's totally fine.
00:15:37 [W] This is actually something that we've been working on improving within the Sig security ourselves is correct providing an Avenue for a synchronous meetings and involvement within this egg.
00:15:47 [W] So all of our meetings are recorded and they're posted to YouTube. So if you can't make any of the meetings you can always go back and watch and listen to anything that we talked about. You can also proposed agenda topics.
00:15:59 [W] Coordinate with other Sig members to represent you during those meeting times. You could also just get involved with some of the other projects that we have.
00:16:07 [W] We do have some smaller working groups within the Sig that are working at different hours across the weeks.
00:16:14 [W] So if you want to get involved check out what it is that we're working on comments on a couple of issues and definitely watch the videos. If you can't make our meeting times.
00:16:24 [W] Yeah.
00:16:24 [W] I just want to add to to what Emily said a lot of
00:16:29 [W] Well, I would say everything that we do is gonna go into either the issue that's on GitHub or in a working document that group is working on an example of that.
00:16:41 [W] Participating asynchronously definitely is something that's doable.
00:16:46 [W] Yeah. Andrew said he's excited to get involved and Brian wants to know what the time expectations are for supporting the group.
00:16:54 [W] So Brian and everyone out there that's listening. I would say it is what you want it to be. So we don't have a minimum amount of time that they really require you to be involved just to say that you're a member of Sig security.
00:17:06 [W] It's up to you.
00:17:07 [W] Sometimes we've got really interesting projects going on and you'll find yourself.
00:17:10 [W] I've completely wrapped up and working on them quite a bit or things slow down a little bit or there's not anything of particular interest going on for you and you might just check in and do our meetings once maybe twice a month.
00:17:22 [W] It's entirely up to you what you make it.
00:17:26 [W] Yeah, you can see the meetings until you find something that's interesting to you.
00:17:32 [W] So yeah, and if you're looking to grow your professional skills or your networking base a lot of the activities that we have upcoming on our roadmap and some of the other projects that we have working on will definitely need leadership
00:17:47 [W] Coordinate and Chorale all the great ideas that everybody in our community brings forward.
00:17:53 [W] So if you're looking to have a little bit higher level of involvement, there's lots of opportunities there.
00:17:58 [W] Yeah, I think that a lot of little things open and the group is really friendly.
00:18:07 [W] So if you're kind of new to this and you want to you know, let us know Sheriff us what you think you would like to do with the group or you
00:18:16 [W] Know what level or other amount of time you can commit you know, you can just reach out to any of us and we can kind of recommend a few activities of a few things to look at.
00:18:28 [W] Raj wanted to know if we offer any recommendations for vulnerability or remediation for cncf project images.
00:18:37 [W] So one of the things about this exam curity is that we do not provide explicit guidance on how to make your particular project secure against a particular vulnerability or more of a Community Driven
00:18:52 [W] That pushes security and Cloud native applications and methodologies there in forward.
00:18:40 [W] So we're not going to tell you.
00:18:41 [W] Hey, there's this critical vulnerability associated with the latest image the latest Alpine image.
00:18:47 [W] This is what you need to do to fix it. That's not what we're about.
00:18:50 [W] We're more about how do we ensure that the container images that are being made to the community are inherently more secure with every release that they have and you see this kind of these kinds of conversations come out within our Sig meetings as well as
00:19:04 [W] through the mailing list.
00:19:05 [W] We've actually had a really awesome conversation going recently about cognitive software security delivery.
00:19:20 [W] Let's see if we've got any more questions.
00:19:25 [W] I am worried.
00:19:27 [W] I will ruin your name if I try to pronounce it, but we did have someone say that they wanted to thank us for the work that we do and that they're going to be looking at our documentation in the near future.
00:19:38 [W] So thank you for that.
00:19:40 [W] I'd like everybody if you're listening into this and you think that this is interesting or you even just have a general question about some of the stuff that the Sig is working on or whether or not something that's of interest and passion to you is in scope.
00:19:54 [W] This sig please jump in the channel and ask us about it.
00:19:58 [W] Admin a cloud Solutions architect or a security practitioner.
00:19:54 [W] We want to have everybody involved in the community because that level of diversity helps ensure that the products and the applications within Cloud native are actually doing the best that they can.
00:20:05 [W] Yeah, I just want to mention though. So since we recorded the stock just yesterday actually the Kata knative security five people has just been released.
00:20:17 [W] you're new to Security on you to count knative security, that will be a nice document to kind of take a look to of it's a pretty nice read.
00:20:28 [W] Yes it is. And if you're not quite up, it's not 36 Pages anywhere.
00:20:34 [W] I think it's at 43.
00:20:35 [W] There's just so much in Cloud need a security space that we had to talk about and we certainly did not cover it all but if you're just looking for a quick primer on it, and then you'll get back to the other 40 pages later.
00:20:47 [W] There is an executive summary so that you can have that on go and get like a quick synopsis of what it is that we're talking about and some of the areas that you can help make your own workloads more secure.
00:21:04 [W] I think I answered everybody's questions.
00:21:06 [W] Does anybody have anything else?
00:21:09 [W] We don't bite and even if we did he couldn't do it through your monitor.
00:21:14 [W] Space that we had to talk about and we certainly did not cover it all but if you're just looking for a quick primer on it and then you'll get back to the other 40 pages later. There is an executive summary so that you can have that on a go and get like a quick synopsis of what it is that we're talking about.
00:22:18 [W] Just that and I did want to see you know, what the community would like like to be more involved in.
00:22:26 [W] They'll be good feedback for us.
00:22:27 [W] Yes, if you think that there's a gap in the cloud knative security Community.
00:22:33 [W] We'd like to know about it.
00:22:34 [W] We probably recognize that it's there too, and I'm trying to figure out ways to close it.
00:23:46 [W] I think that's why you write pretty sure. Yeah. So one of the things that I am super passionate about as a federal employee is ensuring that the
00:24:01 [W] software that exists and it is a use for all technologist is as secure as it possibly can be and that is one of the biggest reasons why I'm involved and security and it's one of the reasons why I'm a huge proponent of
00:24:14 [W] Tribution to open source software and if you're interested in more information about things that are going on in that space I have given several talks about it and there is a lot of other talks that are available on the internet.
00:24:55 [W] Jesse ass is the rapid risk assessment and threat model designed by trail of bits going to be done continuously.
00:25:01 [W] Whoo. That's a good one.
00:25:04 [W] This is one of those it's one of those ongoing conversations that we have with the talk. And internally with this egg is what is the Cadence for security audits as well as security assessments for cloud native applications and
00:25:19 [W] Jesse ass is the rapid risk assessment and threat model designed by trail of bits going to be done continuously.
00:25:25 [W] Whoo.
00:25:27 [W] That's a good one.
00:25:28 [W] This is one of those it's one of those ongoing conversations that we have with the talk. And internally with this egg is what is the Cadence for security audits as well as security assessments for cloud native applications and
00:25:58 [W] Today tan as you saw with the five assessments that we've done we've really had a cloud native security impact focus when were performing our assessments.
00:26:09 [W] So with that brand to do you want to answer the rest of that?
00:26:13 [W] Yeah. So so I think the the couple of things they don't we try and walk out with the TOC. I think ideally we are seeing where we fit in into the kind of ecosystem buildpacks.
00:26:28 [W] Between you know, what projects in sandbox and conviction graduation.
00:26:34 [W] We see ourselves kind of in this case between incubation and graduation where we are saying, okay.
00:26:40 [W] Now that the cncf the project is once you kind of take a beam or investor in the cncf, we're going to do a security assessment as a precursor to you know for most Security review,
00:26:55 [W] You posit incubation process and right now we have our intake process. Is that every year from when assessment is done? We do a check in with the team and really, you know, we
00:27:11 [W] From when the assessment is done.
00:27:06 [W] We do a check in with the team and really in a we evaluate what the scope of changes that has been with the project and if that isn't that much of the project, we just kind of say, you know, here's nothing nothing much as change.
00:27:20 [W] There's no requirement to do a full-blown Security review. But if you know the project has done so well that it's expanded a lot over the year then, you know.
00:27:33 [W] It goes into maybe you should do not security assessment of this that hasn't happened yet, but maybe when I may be it my in the near future, we're always looking at ways that we can help
00:27:48 [W] knative projects recognize when there's a potential security change to their projects and kind of work with us on recognizing when those changes occur and what the impact of those changes occur and whether or not they need to go through another security assessment or potentially
00:28:03 [W] So those are all things that are being discussed right now in this sig as part of the security assessment working group.
00:28:10 [W] Brandon is leading.
00:28:11 [W] So if you're interested in helping out in that space and making an impact definitely comment on one of those tickets to see how you can get involved and help Jesse would like to know who does the continuous threat modeling.
00:28:29 [W] Um, I guess think that's referring to the kind of formal security audit them kissing and that's paid for by the cncf.
00:28:39 [W] That's that would be done by, you know, a company that will give a report from that and it is from from what I understand is a kind of requirement for graduation.
00:28:55 [W] Having a formal security audit them kissing and that's paid for by the cncf.
00:29:00 [W] That's that will be done by you know, a company that will give a report from that and it is from from what I understand is a kind of requirement for graduation.
00:29:32 [W] um, I'm not sure what the stance is therefore doing it continuously whether it's for you or where it goes from there, but I think the idea is that in terms of graduating a project
00:29:48 [W] Understanding that there's a security process.
00:29:51 [W] So it's a gradual process will include this continuous track modeling and I think really what this does cncf and the Sig is doing is looking at the project and making sure that before the project graduates.
00:30:04 [W] It does have everything in place and that the project understands that that why there's a requirement to do all these things and that it should continuously do it.
00:30:16 [W] Just to add on kind of the things on the radar for security and 20 to 1.
00:30:21 [W] So so so you mentioned just now white people has been recently published.
00:30:26 [W] We had another the another effort going on for the security landscape the relates to the fire paper and we're discussing that this would be something that we will follow up and the idea
00:30:41 [W] But if you seen as really break down all the concepts of of planetary security the landscape will be more like okay for all of these Concepts which are the projects are what are the technologies that I
00:30:55 [W] If I would if I were interested in implementing them and Michael system and also because security is such you know something that's all interconnected.
00:30:59 [W] How do these things relate to each other?
00:31:01 [W] For example, you can do a signing of images and things like that, but you know, it's only only makes sense to sign them if you are verifying them on your cluster. So how things work together.
00:31:15 [W] that's the what content landscape that we
00:31:18 [W] So when they try and get started again.
00:31:21 [W] Yeah, we've got a lot that we want to do.
00:31:25 [W] There's a lot of it that we haven't decided on yet.
00:31:28 [W] So I talked a little bit about the cloud knative security weight paper being 43 pages long and it covers a lot but it doesn't cover enough.
00:31:35 [W] There is an opportunity to create individual white papers based off of those specific sections to do a little bit more of a deeper dive and kind of provide a centralized point of collective knowledge about how to do each of those components within a cloud native
00:31:50 [W] Securely and evaluate what's going on in those in that space in the map that back into the landscape Brandon just discussed.
00:31:57 [W] So there's those we've talked about potentially doing a microsite.
00:32:01 [W] Oh, yeah, I believe I believe in whatever slack Channel conversations, but I happen to be a part of we talked about how to Sig band at one point, but there's there's so much going on and
00:32:17 [W] Because security and cloud knative is so massive and there's so much to be done in security is still playing catch-up with the level of innovation that's going on in Industry.
00:32:18 [W] I can expect to be actively involved for a long period of time just as I'm sure Brandon can and there are probably security issues on the horizon that we don't even know about yet.
00:32:30 [W] Yeah, I think security for the sake is a little bit of a special case in which it it kind of touches every almost every single project.
00:32:40 [W] That's a security aspect of it. So that's that's where it gets a little bit tricky because you know, when we decide to do something we need to make sure we can be able to scare that as well.
00:32:53 [W] Yeah, that's actually a good point and one of the reasons why we we started Cloud native security day is because with Q Khan and Cloud native con there was a security check and there was a lot of really great talks that we're going on there, but many
00:33:08 [W] Or kubernative focused and there's a lot more in the cloud knative security ecosystem.
00:33:09 [W] that's built on top of kubernative. Zu rides along cited that helps provide more secure Services more secure workloads and more secure products to end users.
00:33:19 [W] So having Cloud native security day again coming up virtual EU 2020 one. It's going to happen.
00:33:29 [W] That's something that's on her road map and we're looking forward to it for sure, but there's lots
00:33:34 [W] Definitely lots and we're always looking for more things to do and more community members to help us make it happen.
00:33:41 [W] It's a good problem.
00:33:43 [W] It is a good problem.
00:33:53 [W] So I think that's it.
00:33:55 [W] Yeah, I think we are on the top of the session as well.
00:33:59 [W] Yes. Sorry.
00:34:02 [W] Well, thank you so much for joining us everybody.
00:34:04 [W] Check out the slack Channel's hit us up if you have any more questions.
00:34:10 [W] All right.
00:34:10 [W] Thank you co listen.
