00:00:00 [W] Hello everyone.
00:00:01 [W] Thank you for attending our session virtually today.
00:00:04 [W] We are going to talk about how to multiply the power of Argo projects by using them together.
00:00:31 [W] Hello everyone.
00:00:32 [W] Thank you for attending our session virtually today.
00:00:36 [W] We are going to talk about how to multiply the power of Argo projects by using them together.
00:00:41 [W] It's a really exciting topic.
00:00:44 [W] For instance.
00:00:44 [W] We have done a lot for the past year.
00:00:46 [W] name is home one micro speaker is Alexander mutations of we are both principal Engineers from into it here is overview. We will talk about who you are the movie to the project.
00:01:00 [W] Day and the last but not the least the most exciting demo.
00:01:06 [W] We are from in cured.
00:01:08 [W] We have nice thousands employees in 20 countries serving 16 Millions customers all over the world.
00:01:14 [W] We create Financial products for our customers. And our we are the creator of TurboTax QuickBooks and meat.
00:01:24 [W] The Argo project is a set of the kubernative knative tools for deploying running jobs and applications.
00:01:32 [W] It's a use gitops paradigms such as continuous delivery and Progressive delivery and the able mlperf on kubernative.
00:01:41 [W] It is made of four independent project. I will go into individual one soon.
00:01:49 [W] We got a very strong community.
00:01:51 [W] The product has been recognized and used by a lot of companies.
00:01:55 [W] We got a accepted as cncf incubator project and have 10,000 Stars 500 contributors and the 170 end-user companies recently.
00:02:09 [W] We created the bootstrap committee with members from into it Black Rock red hat and Alibaba to help with the governor.
00:02:18 [W] Ali Baba to help with the governor's the idea is to keep the project stable and provided the direction for each product.
00:02:26 [W] We are very proud of the current progress and enjoyed being part of the open source Community. Then let's jump into the individual projects we have
00:02:37 [W] Alright, let's start with workflow and events.
00:02:41 [W] Argo workflows is containerd knative workflow engine. Argo events is event-based that dependency manager.
00:02:51 [W] We recently released the Argo events 1.0 which was a huge milestone for us.
00:02:57 [W] Please check it out.
00:02:58 [W] It is the most flexible stable and scalable regarding Argo workflows.
00:03:03 [W] The core features are relatively stable.
00:03:06 [W] So we went deeper to help with more special use cases for example memorization which helps reuse the remember output when rerun to speed up the progress and reduced.
00:03:20 [W] Cost and the mutex is help Garden on shareable resources like databases.
00:03:25 [W] The crown workflow is another handy enhancement to replace chromed Rob which allows you run more than just a single part in Chrome Manner and also a lot of the user experience enhancement for the future.
00:03:40 [W] Dress more scouting reliability and performance issues and plan to add a user interface for Argo events.
00:03:50 [W] Argo City is very popular project.
00:03:52 [W] A lot of companies have used data as the backbone deployment solution to kubenetes clusters.
00:03:59 [W] So we have worked very hard on the performance and scalability related issues.
00:04:04 [W] Currently it can support a 2,000 applications 100 cluster and also modulus repositories, which the agro-ecosystem several sub project has been reached out to a good level of the maturity.
00:04:20 [W] I'm done. The string sends Argo City story here applications that to support the application of applications pattern gitops engine as a reusable library that implements
00:04:36 [W] Feature image updater which monitor, dr. Registrate and automatically updated image notifications helps notify users about the important state changes for the future.
00:04:35 [W] We plan to do the gitops agent which will be a light weighted Argo City based on the gitops engine and also the serviceability is another area.
00:04:45 [W] We would like to put more effort as more and more companies are running, Argo City.
00:04:50 [W] In a large scale, we would like to provide more tools to get inside around the system.
00:04:57 [W] Uncle Ross is the youngest Argo project as a declarative progress ofthe delivery and and experimentation to however it's God's a good momentum more and more companies.
00:05:12 [W] we still find a solution in this area ADP Spotify into it and many other companies have adopted Argo rods from the basic standpoint are gonna Rouse supports to update strategies blue
00:05:16 [W] All right.
00:05:08 [W] However, it's try is in the detail.
00:05:10 [W] It supports the fine grain waited traffic shifting which the integration of Ingress controller and the servicemeshcon.
00:05:40 [W] Thank you for intellectual honk and thank you for great update about every Argo project and I'm going to talk about how you can get the maximum out of our goal by using the projects together.
00:05:52 [W] So Alpha projects are not really tightly coupled with each other.
00:05:57 [W] They are focused on just one use case and trying to do it as best as possible.
00:06:01 [W] still you can use them all together and they didn't compliment nicely each other and together all four.
00:06:10 [W] Combine a very powerful application delivery platform and we can talk a lot about why it is true but one demo worth 1000 words. So instead of explaining why I'm just going to show you how
00:06:26 [W] Here is what we are going to do.
00:06:25 [W] So we're going to build a scalable and visited system which implements a real use case and we're not going to coat instead.
00:06:34 [W] We're going to use existing open source projects and each project again. Don't know much about each other.
00:06:41 [W] It just do its work and we're going to use Intel go to go everything together and make them work together.
00:06:48 [W] And as I mentioned we're not going to write a single line of code.
00:06:53 [W] Except we will have to write some llamo and thank you for watching con. Talk about llamo if you are, but we see as I'm doing the demo.
00:07:04 [W] I'm going to prove you that that llamo providers so much benefit. So it's totally worth to spend time writing it.
00:07:12 [W] Okay, let's move on.
00:07:13 [W] So a little bit more details about what exactly we're going to build.
00:07:17 [W] So we're going to create a web service.
00:07:20 [W] So and web service is going to have a user interface, which is here on the graph.
00:07:26 [W] So file / is going to be our user interface first.
00:07:32 [W] verse - is an open source project that implements a user interface to different storage has including stream. So
00:07:42 [W] Next component is our extra storage space his minion and I'm sure a lot of you first about menu.
00:07:48 [W] Structural little component. So algorithms is another infrastructure layer component. It is going to listen to every event in me.
00:07:44 [W] Oh and every time a new file is uploaded arguments will break will trigger a cargo workflow in background.
00:07:52 [W] So an Argo workflow is going to download the file from the menu.
00:07:58 [W] It will use face detect which is an open open source project that implements all
00:08:05 [W] that machine learning magic so and phase detector will get access to that image and it will detect faces on the image and it will produce a new image which has all the faces highlighted and upload it back to
00:08:20 [W] Sighs - will show us, you know, the uploaded image with the faces plus we are going to have kind of to control plane components one is our BCG and roll outs.
00:08:22 [W] So prologues is going to manage files - and city managers can of the whole thing.
00:08:27 [W] Okay seems like I think we're ready to go.
00:08:31 [W] So and by the way, you can do the same demo by yourself. So if you open that URL right here
00:08:39 [W] Let me open it.
00:08:41 [W] And so you will be redirected to the treatme page of the git repository and they didn't file page much have introduction to this presentation.
00:08:52 [W] It explains.
00:08:54 [W] You know, what we're going to build with what functionality we're going to get and you really you can start from let's do it Bart.
00:09:03 [W] And it's time to do it also during the demo.
00:09:08 [W] So so far we kind of talked about that system from user perspective, you know top to bottom.
00:09:16 [W] So we talked about application the user interface and then infrastructure and then control plane to execute the demo have to kind of do it in reverse order.
00:09:25 [W] order. So first of all, we need to create the control plane and before we create the control
00:09:32 [W] We need the cluster.
00:09:33 [W] Be redirected to the new page of the get depository and they didn't file patent which have introduction to this presentation. It explains. You know, what we're going to build with what functionality we were going to get and you really you can start
00:11:30 [W] And I already have minikube planning and you're free to use whatever cluster you want to use.
00:11:36 [W] So let me go ahead and create Argo City first.
00:11:42 [W] So before I create anything, I just want to show you that I have a brand-new me to Cluster.
00:11:50 [W] It was created 26 minutes ago. And what I need to do, I need to execute to keep CTL commands to create are besieging one is just create algo CG namespace.
00:12:01 [W] Let's make it a little bigger and second.
00:12:06 [W] I need to execute Cube CTL apply and all that that keeps still apply just
00:12:13 [W] Push the typical Instagrams installation into my minikube cluster.
00:12:19 [W] So let's go ahead and do it.
00:12:20 [W] And this is a Argo City is created in the background minikube download images that containers.
00:12:29 [W] So the next thing we should do is we need to configure our control plane to deploy the rest of the infrastructure. So and as you might know, Argo City,
00:12:42 [W] It's user interface and the CLA so you can use cri-o UI to configure our ci/cd imperative lie, or you can use a declarative configuration, which is really nice for the demo and
00:12:57 [W] You can use cri-o UI to configure our message imperative lie, or you can use a declarative configuration, which is really nice for the demo and to apply the declarative configuration.
00:13:10 [W] I just need to execute one more Cube C elegans and she's very handy and I just want to go ahead and do it right away.
00:13:20 [W] And next I want to jump back to the repository and show you what we just did. So first of all, let's take a look at the file, which we just send to the minikube cluster.
00:13:37 [W] So here's the trial and it's just the llamo file which has several objects and let's talk about the subjects.
00:13:47 [W] So first of all, we are seeing here an instance of customer service official called application and let's spend a couple minutes just to talk about what at the application is.
00:13:59 [W] So application is an abstraction which targeted introduces and it's pretty much our purposes you configuration to better understand what it is.
00:14:09 [W] We should just take a look at applications big and we really just need to focus on these two fields.
00:14:15 [W] So first of all, we I think there is a source and destination.
00:14:20 [W] Let's talk about source. So Source explained RBG.
00:14:26 [W] Where is your desired cluster State located?
00:14:29 [W] So it just points to a directory in a git Repository.
00:14:33 [W] I work with GG were manifest supposed to be installed.
00:14:36 [W] And in this case, we're going to install into the same cluster where Argo City is running and we are going to use Cube condemn own namespace.
00:14:44 [W] So once everything is created we should get a condom on namespace and that's pretty much it will have several applications here instead of looking at this applications in this llamo file.
00:14:57 [W] Let's move back to the repository and take a look at the files in the Repository.
00:15:03 [W] So we have infrastructure components here and our web application that leverages infrastructure.
00:15:11 [W] Let's take a look at infrastructure first and there is nothing this is the least interesting part, I guess so here you could just see, you know, some minor tweaks which are related to install Argo events rollouts Workforce and menu such
00:15:27 [W] Question that leverages infrastructure.
00:15:21 [W] Let's take a look at infrastructure first and there is nothing this is the least interesting part, I guess so here you could just see, you know, some minor tweaks which are related to install Argo events rollouts Workforce and menu such as
00:15:45 [W] It's a bucket and some Arabic rules and next more interesting part, but the web application which actually leverages that infrastructure.
00:15:58 [W] So first of all, here we have.
00:16:03 [W] Roll out object.
00:16:04 [W] Let me find it.
00:16:05 [W] Here. It is. So roll out as you might know is like a big brother of knative kubernative deployment and it does the same same job as deployment. It creates replicas which creates ports and eventually
00:16:20 [W] Plus it supports Advanced deployment strategies.
00:16:26 [W] And in this case, I'm using blue green. So and as you can see this particular row load eventually creates file storage container.
00:16:35 [W] That's it. And in addition to roll out, we have two interesting objects. One is eventsource eventsource is configured is configured argue events to watch for advancing in a steel bucket.
00:16:50 [W] And then sensor is the most interesting one it eventually produces the workflow and this workflow literally consists of two steps.
00:16:57 [W] So first step find faces and it's based on
00:17:04 [W] This image which I created for the demo basically just triggers Faith detect and you know couple parameters and finally the Second Step upload result back to sleep.
00:17:15 [W] If I think this is it that's covered everything in that repository and we're ready to go check what I wish he did for us in the background.
00:17:25 [W] I need to first of all start minikube also start tunnel.
00:17:34 [W] So we can access.
00:17:36 [W] Oleg Services, okay.
00:17:38 [W] while it's working.
00:17:43 [W] Let me just talk a little bit about like how we can do that so we can use Cube CTL to inspect our cluster. But that is kind of it's boring and not easy, especially given that we have Argo UI and argue
00:17:58 [W] Formation about our cluster seems like tunnel has started or I know buddy. So next we need to we need to actually punch Argo City service and change it to load balancer type.
00:18:07 [W] So it will be available outside of a cluster next tunnel wants me to ask to give it a password so it can open access to Port 18 and finally Argo City should be available
00:18:22 [W] Wants me to ask to give it a password so it can open access to Port 18 and finally Argo City should be available just on local courts Coast Port 18 seems like
00:18:26 [W] Cohorts cause for at 18 seems like it's up.
00:18:30 [W] This is great. Next we need to login and built-in user is admin and password is a host name is a code name.
00:18:41 [W] So go ahead and use it and
00:18:47 [W] Create so as you can see that.
00:18:50 [W] Okay, by the way, this is Argo City user interface and what it does it show us all the applications in configured in Argo City gym and as expected we have filed applications here for infrastructure components such as Argo events allows Workforce and
00:19:06 [W] And there is a web service and as you can see all the icons are green, and this is great because it showed to us that all the components are up and running and running means not just
00:19:21 [W] also all the ports started Readiness probes and not failing their successful all the services goes that IP addresses and pretty much everything is ready to use and this is kind of
00:19:28 [W] To do is not just the gitops a perimeter.
00:19:30 [W] This is also a very powerful powerful kubernative dashboard and you can use it to learn a lot about your kubernative cluster.
00:19:37 [W] So if you want to learn about more details about each of your application, you can locate the required application on the screen click on the element and let's use a cargo of Workforce as example.
00:19:53 [W] click on the tournament and I was a directed to workflow Details page and it actually has a lot of details here and I guess the most interesting one is that tree view which show us all the resources which are part of
00:20:05 [W] Force application, but in this demo, I'm really interested in just in the service.
00:20:02 [W] So let me see the filter service here and Argo Workforce has couple services and I'm interested in our Grist server service.
00:20:13 [W] it's available on Port on Local Host because they use minikube and I really need a port from here and let's go ahead and try to open that URL.
00:20:25 [W] Yeah, so here we go.
00:20:26 [W] We have Argo workflows user interface and we opened it on purpose because we are going to need it for the demo and Argo workflow user interface is pretty much.
00:20:39 [W] It's a separator console that operator can use to see background which jobs you know how they're progressing in real time.
00:20:48 [W] And then finally we need more one more URL. So we basically we want to access our
00:20:55 [W] location which is file stash
00:20:58 [W] and I also just need a port so Port is that 0900 one? Okay, here's fast as user interface and
00:21:11 [W] as expected it has no images here because we have not uploaded anything here to mirror. So we just showing to us that nothing is created and this is it. So I think I just want to kind of take a quick opposed and recap what we have done.
00:21:25 [W] Tena koe cluster and we literally run just three commands want to create namespace and then took a particular player commands and we've got the whole system up and running and let's go ahead and prove the actually working and upload
00:21:38 [W] Writing and let's go ahead and prove it actually working and upload an image.
00:21:30 [W] So here's the upload button.
00:21:33 [W] Of course. I have image prepared ahead of time.
00:21:36 [W] I'm going to use that friends poster.
00:21:40 [W] Sorry stranger things fans. I like friends more.
00:21:45 [W] So what should happen now is that red blooded an image and Argo work Argo events should detect it and it should trigger a workflow. So if we
00:21:54 [W] move to Argo workflows user interface that we can see that what workflow is running right now.
00:22:00 [W] Let's click on it.
00:22:01 [W] click on it and see the details. So basically this UI is going to visualize steps as the steps, you know, execute and you can use it that you are to even get more information.
00:22:13 [W] For example, you can click on the step and you can go to events and see what exactly is happening.
00:22:19 [W] was the loading image.
00:22:24 [W] Then it started the containerd now it waits for a container.
00:22:31 [W] And let's give it a couple more seconds.
00:22:35 [W] To complete these come on.
00:22:43 [W] It's still in revising or find out if it's right it goes on and immediately succeeded. So basically that was fine faces it hopefully found the faces and then eventually pass it back parsec next to upload is out step
00:22:58 [W] Step is doing the same.
00:22:59 [W] Okay, so it's putting the image created the container started the container and I suspect my minikube is quite busy.
00:23:07 [W] But let's give it a couple more seconds to complete.
00:23:10 [W] So it's learning. Hopefully uploading data 2 is 3 and it's done awesome.
00:23:16 [W] So if everything worked fine, we should go back to it first - and refresh the page and we've got a second image which has faces on it. So awesome.
00:23:28 [W] And I feel like it's really excited and I did promise to talk about llamo a little bit and so llamo didn't just give us a fully working system and we would start it in one
00:23:43 [W] In addition to that that Yama actually encapsulated the whole application lifecycle and we don't have to reinvent it again, and I'm referring to Argo rollouts object in this case.
00:23:48 [W] And I'm referring to I'll go roll out subject in this case.
00:23:45 [W] So Argo rollouts object actually supports Bluegreen strategy. And the way Bluegreen is supposed to be done is actually encapsulated in this four five lines of llamo.
00:23:57 [W] So, I think it's really excited. And yeah that's ends my demo and please go ahead and try to do it yourself and try to upgrade
00:24:10 [W] I'll stash using instructions in the knee and see blue green.
00:24:14 [W] I'm great strategy life and this is not the end.
00:24:20 [W] I did want to mention one more component which is kind of hidden, but it's also a very important and that component is gitops engine.
00:24:30 [W] So what is gitops intron gitops engine is a library that was kind of created out of Argo City. So what we did we took out
00:24:40 [W] Fergus EG the implementation of Corgi tops features and put it into a library are usable go and kill every and that Library includes not just a basic it also has advanced gitops features such as
00:24:55 [W] Sink waves and when much more so and that Library powers are basiji for quite a while already.
00:25:04 [W] And what happened is that library is getting mature more and more and we are really happy to welcome a new consumer.
00:25:13 [W] that is gitlab. So and I'm super excited to tell you that gitlab actually recently released an alpha version of gitlab agent, which is
00:25:25 [W] active in cluster component that beta much integrates gitlab and communities and it is powered by gitops engine and why it is so exciting.
00:25:36 [W] Is that because now we actually share the same code so both gitlab and Argo City does gitops in pretty much the same way and teams actually care about collaborating and working on new features and Bug fixes,
00:25:51 [W] Of great stuff some and this is it.
00:25:45 [W] Thanks a lot for listening to our demo and update about the project and please go ahead ask your questions if you have any
00:26:01 [W] hello.
00:26:01 [W] Hello everyone.
00:26:03 [W] So thank you for all the questions. I think we actually getting a flood of the questions in the channel.
00:26:08 [W] So we are trying our best to answer here Alex.
00:26:11 [W] Maybe you can start.
00:26:13 [W] Yes, can you please confirm you can hear me now?
00:26:17 [W] I can hear you.
00:26:18 [W] So you may need to call the question that own answer.
00:26:21 [W] Okay, so I think I'm going to ask for several more popular questions because they keep getting into the chat.
00:26:30 [W] So I think yes. The first question is about Argo and flux collaboration.
00:26:37 [W] And is it failed or not failed?
00:26:40 [W] I think answer is it's not filled and at the same time it's on hold and the main reason is that
00:26:47 [W] Steam is actually actively working on second version of flux, which is flux to and gitops to keep component. So migration to gitops engine which was the essence of collaboration is just not the first priority for them and I hope that
00:27:02 [W] Is the current agenda they can move on to gitops engine and try to adopt it as well.
00:26:57 [W] And and that's effectively going to be a continuation of the same collaboration.
00:27:03 [W] Hopefully that answers the question though and the next question.
00:27:09 [W] I'm not going to recreate literally repeat it again because it was asked for several times, but I will try to give a summary.
00:27:16 [W] So the question is several people asked how the quota we're going to do to simplify management of application at scale.
00:27:28 [W] as I understand from the question some people struggle with
00:27:32 [W] The repository which has the tone of yellow files and it's not easy to kind of create applications for them as well as some performance issues.
00:27:39 [W] So I think this is so we're working on two projects one is is not the project is a one is next TV. So far. BCG is going to have a lot of performance improvements that make
00:27:54 [W] Work better is a large repositories which has a lot of Yama files and that will solve performance problem.
00:27:49 [W] And the second issue is management problem like how to create hundreds of Argo City applications and don't get lost and this is the next project which is called application set right now application set is a separate
00:28:04 [W] CLG and as a quick summary all it does it let you define kind of powerful template that can discover applications in get in.
00:28:09 [W] On the file system or it can create application for every cluster connected to our go see Jean. So then this is work in progress right now, and it's a separate project right now and we plan to merge it as soon as this table into, Argo City.
00:28:26 [W] Hopefully that answers the question.
00:28:32 [W] okay, I can I can I can have next one so does our Lord has UI and the answer is we don't have a daddy the UI for our routes and but we do have some integration in Argo City side can interact with our garage directly
00:28:47 [W] It's a simple product right now and we plan to merge it as soon as this table into, Argo City.
00:28:51 [W] Hopefully that answers the question.
00:28:57 [W] Okay, I can I can I can have next one. So does Argo Rod has UI and the answer is we don't have a daddy he that UI for other routes and but we do have some integration in Argo City side can interact with our garage directly
00:29:49 [W] Currently we are still working on our Laurels to stabilize everything but it's already production-ready has Rich functionality.
00:29:56 [W] That's our youngest of project. And please give it a try and we are using that in our production into it as of now, and we already know the Spotify also using the are aroused very extensively trying to do that.
00:30:12 [W] and I think there are question about is that does our goal manage Helm chart deployments to I think we want to give the answer here is the Argo City is Manifest generator agnostic
00:30:27 [W] Standing point is we do support a customized how much our and adding under customization and case on it if I remember and we do also supporting the customized binary which can generate in the Manifest
00:30:42 [W] Really want to do some customization to the next level.
00:30:44 [W] So our LCD is generate the Manifest generator agnostic make sure do and I want to add a little bit. So Argo City also support a Helm repositories so you can bypass can do get and you can point Argo City directly
00:30:59 [W] Wasn't it and even in most recent release which will be published this week?
00:31:02 [W] We introduced it introduced integration is I think it's called OCR registry of Hell yet.
00:31:12 [W] So Argo has I would say yes, so it supports each other planets.
00:31:19 [W] Yeah.
00:31:20 [W] Yeah. Another question is regarding Argo events and other workflows. And what's the difference between the Canadian tekton?
00:31:28 [W] So the quote we already answered.
00:31:30 [W] So the question answer is the Argo what from currently is more generic workflow engine. It can do almost all cases if you need a workflow and currently is mostly focused on MLM data processing time and tekton is focused on the
00:31:45 [W] Duration, and the provided the first class support for the CI.
00:31:47 [W] So I think we are on a different track but workflow is writing generic. It can be leveraged for all-purpose. Like we using workflow internally to drive the operational tasks for sophisticated operational
00:32:02 [W] To do yeah.
00:31:59 [W] Okay, I can take the next one.
00:32:01 [W] So the question was about right back feature.
00:32:04 [W] And for those who don't know at least that feature was created first in flux.
00:32:09 [W] So the feature allows gitops operator to watch for new images in Docker registry and then automatically push New Image tags into back into the Kata voice three, that's why it's called image right back.
00:32:24 [W] so current currently adversity don't have that feature knative.
00:32:29 [W] But there is another project called Argo image of data Argo City image of data. So at the current stage, it doesn't write image tag back to get instead updates image tag in Argo City
00:32:44 [W] And we originated first step to support rating back to the kit.
00:32:50 [W] And basically you'll find more details in the list book about what we did exactly and I feel I hope we can deliver the teacher can do fully either in the next by Charities or next major release, which is 1.9.
00:33:03 [W] But it's on a roadmap and it's kind of it's been it's in the near future.
00:33:12 [W] Okay, f****** prom do what to the next question.
00:33:21 [W] I think someone is asking our routes with Ambassador.
00:33:25 [W] So I just want to answer the we supporting the SMI the servicemeshcon ter face.
00:33:31 [W] So as long as whatever the servicemeshcon in Tim Plantation has that support the our garage supports that and since we have so many players in this field.
00:33:45 [W] I think they're okay.
00:33:47 [W] I don't know whether you can still see us.
00:33:50 [W] Maybe I'll try the next questions.
00:33:52 [W] That's Argo what flowmill has scheduler similar to air flow.
00:33:56 [W] We are supporting the SMI the servicemeshcon ter face.
00:33:53 [W] So as long as the whatever is a servicemeshcon Clint implementation has that support the armor also supports that and since we have so many players in this field.
00:34:07 [W] I think they're okay.
00:34:09 [W] I don't know whether you can still see us.
00:34:13 [W] Maybe I'll try the next questions.
00:34:15 [W] That's Argo workflow has scheduler similar to air flow.
00:34:19 [W] answer is yes, we have the crown workflow and we also has other events which can trigger. The Argo will flow should give you the enough flexibility there to mimic to do the scheduling our on-demand or event-based.
00:34:35 [W] And I feel like we basically have to wrap up now, but I think we can continue answer questions in slack and I will try to copy paste questions if it still exists with a male bull Dance For Us in this life in
00:35:05 [W] And I feel like we basically have to wrap up now, but I think we can continue answer questions in slack and I will try to Opie Place questions if it still exists with a male who transfers in this life
00:35:20 [W] Thank you everyone.
00:35:22 [W] So when you create cashier one.
