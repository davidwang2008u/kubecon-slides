00:00:00 [W] Hi kubernative.
00:00:00 [W] Thanks so much for joining me today.
00:00:09 [W] My name is Jen.
00:00:10 [W] 15 and prior to that I was practicing as a psychologist.
00:00:15 [W] I am the founder of growth coaching Institute and not surprisingly stress and mental health come up a lot in the work that I do especially now more than ever.
00:00:27 [W] I want to start by clarifying something that is that mental illness is not real and by that. I mean it is a made of term by society and adopted by even very reputable organizations and with good
00:00:42 [W] It is a made-up term by society and adopted by even very reputable organizations and with good intention to bring more awareness to mental health, but the reality is that the mental health challenges that we are referring to are not
00:00:57 [W] Is that we are referring to are not illnesses and to some this word can be attributed to a very real stigma that already exists.
00:01:07 [W] When you read about mental illness statistics, what is being referred to is a diagnosed mental health condition or a mental health disorder as defined by the DSM or ICD?
00:01:18 [W] No disorder is not much less stigmatizing than illness.
00:01:24 [W] But let's just be on the same page about what is being referred to when we hear or read about mental illness diagnosed mental health conditions require one to meet a set of criteria or symptoms outlined.
00:01:37 [W] In these manuals and also has two that that symptom set has to negatively and significantly impact one or more areas of life.
00:01:48 [W] That's why you can have symptoms of anxiety depression autism OCD ADHD, but not meet the diagnostic criteria.
00:01:57 [W] So when we look at prevalence statistics, we know that approximately 20% of the population has a diagnosed mental health condition and
00:02:07 [W] And 5% have what is referred to as a serious mental health condition like schizophrenia or bipolar?
00:02:14 [W] I am pretty open about my diagnosis of bipolar to again help dispel the stigma around these issues stigma is very real and many people who are struggling don't reach out for help because of the shame they feel that something is wrong with them or
00:02:29 [W] Trying hard enough and if you're feeling shame just know that you're not alone and there is help you can start by talking to a therapist or coach who might be able to help themselves or point you in the right direction.
00:02:41 [W] There hasn't been a lot of research done on mental health and then Tech Community but open sourcing mental illness is a nonprofit that focuses in this area and has been collecting data since 2016.
00:02:56 [W] I as well as the ongoing survey that you can opt into and what it has shown over the years is that the prevalence of diagnosed mental health conditions in our industry is higher than the general population.
00:02:50 [W] So then the question comes up why?
00:02:53 [W] And we don't really know because again the research is limited.
00:02:57 [W] There are also some research limitations such as reporter bias, since we can't require professionals to disclose this medical information.
00:03:05 [W] So this statistic may be inflated, but it is also likely higher than the general population. I believe and I do have a theory about why and it starts with
00:03:20 [W] So burnout is not a medical term.
00:03:18 [W] It is understood as prolonged exposure to stretch its prolonged exposure to stress.
00:03:25 [W] It is energy loss without recovery other terms people use to refer to this are adrenal failure or acute stress disorder.
00:03:36 [W] And it happens when your brain and body exists in the state of fight or flight for a long time and without any break restorative break.
00:03:46 [W] So adaptively this heightened state of stress was necessary to keep us safe.
00:03:50 [W] Our brains prepared our bodies to fight or run from a predator.
00:03:54 [W] It uses our energy to run rather than to think because that is what we needed when threatened by the Predators. The problem is that humans are not equipped to exist in a
00:04:06 [W] Constant state of fight or flight and when we are exposed to stress over a long period of time in particularly in particular if we do not balance it with restoration. It manifests as symptoms of anxiety
00:04:21 [W] depression
00:04:15 [W] And this is something that's understood well in the research and medical field prolonged stress leads to symptoms of anxiety and depression.
00:04:24 [W] So it is not surprising.
00:04:29 [W] If you look at the osm I research that mood disorders such as depressant depression and anxiety are the most diagnosed conditions reported in technology year after year.
00:04:42 [W] But what I find even more interesting are those professionals who do not report a medical diagnosis, but believe they have an undiagnosed medical mental health condition.
00:04:53 [W] So year after year, excluding 2017, which I could not locate mood and anxiety disorders are reported as most prevalent and then not surprising is that stress
00:05:08 [W] and and then not surprising is that stress syndromes are also reported consistently and I believe that there is not a higher prevalence of diagnosed mental health conditions and
00:05:12 [W] There is an over diagnosis of anxiety and depression due to stress and burnout.
00:05:23 [W] Working in technology is demanding stress in technology is normalized and even applauded and so to understand burn out. We need to look at the stress that's causing it.
00:05:37 [W] stress hormones cause your blood vessels to constrict and divert more oxygen to your muscles that you have the strength to fight or run from the bear except you are not being chased by a bear and when your oxygen is
00:05:52 [W] Ecology is normalized and even applauded and so to understand burn out. We need to look at the stress that's causing it.
00:06:02 [W] stress hormones cause your blood vessels to constrict and divert more oxygen to your muscles that you have the strength to fight or run from the bear except you are not being chased by a bear and when your oxygen is
00:06:53 [W] Muscles less is going to your brain specifically your prefrontal cortex, which is what we actually need to address modern-day stressors.
00:07:04 [W] So why are we in technology so stressed?
00:07:09 [W] Stressors unique to technology include things like equivocal deadlines which are unique to working in Innovation long hours on call very high expectations very frequent failure.
00:07:24 [W] Impostor syndrome and then there are all the other everyday stressors, you know that we as humans all experience and then there's the unexpected stressors such
00:07:39 [W] Experience and then there's the unexpected stressors such as a global pandemic.
00:07:40 [W] The pandemic right now is highlighting a human response to something that goes very unrecognized and Israeli rarely discussed that being that the world is very uncertain the state of the world right now makes this undeniably true
00:07:56 [W] As an Israeli rarely discussed that being that the world is very uncertain the state of the world right now makes this undeniably true and as humans, we really struggle with uncertainty.
00:08:10 [W] Certainty creates comfort and we like to be comfortable.
00:08:15 [W] there is less fear and more Comfort when we have certainty if we are certain a bear is not going to chase us we can feel more at ease and whether we realize it or not, we are constantly trying to create certainty and comfort in our lives.
00:08:29 [W] We do things like stay in jobs or relationships that aren't healthy follow leaders who ensure a certainty don't ask for feedback don't
00:08:39 [W] Risks avoid or deny reality all to maintain comfort by avoiding the inevitable uncertainty in the world and in our lives and uncertainty goes hand in hand with discomfort.
00:08:55 [W] and anxiety stress and fear
00:09:01 [W] Perhaps the greatest emotional discomfort we experience as humans is fear right now across the world fear is dominating how we think how we feel how we Act and the decisions. We make fear can be very healthy
00:09:16 [W] Debilitating and when it is people go to Great Lengths to stop the fear.
00:09:15 [W] But remember we are not being chased by a bear where once we needed fear to flee the bear.
00:09:22 [W] Our legs are not going to help us Escape.
00:09:27 [W] Today is scary stuff.
00:09:28 [W] Definitely not a pandemic.
00:09:31 [W] When we are disconnected from fear and our other feelings those emotions control us, they dictate our emotional state and also our behaviors.
00:09:42 [W] So let's talk about what we can do to be more aware and not let our emotional experience. Totally. Hijack us.
00:09:52 [W] Simply foot put what you think is what you feel.
00:09:56 [W] If you want to stop feeling stressed and anxious, for example, you need to stop attending to the thoughts that are resulting in those emotions if your thoughts are I don't know how I'm going to meet this deadline. You might feel anxious if you think I have
00:10:11 [W] A isn't manageable you might feel overwhelmed. If you think I can't meet these expectations.
00:10:15 [W] I'm not skilled enough.
00:10:16 [W] I am not good enough, you might feel insecurity or what we often refer to as imposter syndrome.
00:10:22 [W] If you are thinking things are so hard and I can't do anything to manage them better.
00:10:28 [W] You'll probably feel helpless hopeless if you think the world is ending.
00:10:35 [W] You might feel panic.
00:10:38 [W] Important to note is that breaks are not avoidance.
00:10:41 [W] The goal is not to take a break from hard emotions and definitely all of the emotions mentioned so far including fear and insecurity serve a healthy purpose if acknowledged with your Noggin, which is hard to do when your body is preparing in an existing in a state to run
00:10:56 [W] you must take breaks from attending to the thoughts that are leading to emotions that require such a great amount of energy because you cannot live in a constant state of anxiety and fear for example without eventually burning out and it just
00:11:00 [W] all the time
00:10:52 [W] rumination requires a lot of cognitive mental and sometimes emotional energy and if you exist in a constant state of rumination, it impacts all three of these areas and you live in what I call a rabbit hole
00:11:07 [W] Leads to catastrophizing where instead of there being one thing to ruminate on everything else piles on your amygdala freaks out your oxygen heads to the muscles and it's hard to think rationally to address the emotions the purpose.
00:11:17 [W] They are still serving you and What needs your attention this can lead to all sorts of health conditions burnout anxiety attacks and even panic attacks.
00:11:28 [W] Let's talk about the toilet paper situation.
00:11:31 [W] According t p is not a rational Behavior.
00:11:34 [W] Even if the world ran out of toilet paper during a pandemic. It is not a life-threatening concern.
00:11:40 [W] We have lots of soft material clothing in our homes to wipe our butts with but the pandemic makes uncertainty very real and hard to ignore and for most of us.
00:11:50 [W] no one taught us how to deal with uncertainty and fear growing up. You are afraid you don't know what to do. You see other people storageos.
00:11:58 [W] You up on a Year's worth supply of toilet paper.
00:12:02 [W] So you do the same and here we have a collective social panic.
00:12:09 [W] So what can we do that might be more effective than hoarding toilet paper.
00:12:15 [W] So what if I told you I have an intervention a really effective one the AIDS and Stress Management helps your memory improves processing speed improves creativity improves problem-solving helps you think rationally helps you perform
00:12:30 [W] helps dealing with conflict easier makes dealing with uncertainty less scary gives you more energy keeps you slim lowers food cravings protects you from cancer and dementia words off cold and the flu lowers your
00:12:42 [W] Attack stroke diabetes helps you feel happier less depressed less anxious helps you avoid burnout helps you live longer.
00:12:39 [W] Well I do.
00:12:44 [W] If you are not sleeping your top priority should be figuring out how to make sure you are or why you are not sleeping significantly impacts every area of your life your mood your ability to be productive and execute how you
00:12:59 [W] Tekton challenges problem-solving find out why you aren't sleeping address this before anything else. It can alleviate a lot of issues.
00:13:07 [W] Don't be the professional who believes their lack of sleep shows how committed they are to working hard sleep helps you recover from being chased by the bear.
00:13:15 [W] If you don't sleep you keep running from the bear and you would eventually run out you eventually burn out there isn't enough time to dive into sleep more but there's plenty of research out there.
00:13:27 [W] there that you can access yourself one book recommendation I have for you is why we sleep so to yoga is popular because people see the benefits you don't need to be a yogi
00:13:42 [W] there isn't enough time to dive into sleep more but there's plenty of research out there that you can access yourself one book recommendation I have for you is why we sleep so to yoga is
00:14:13 [W] Just stretch bend over hang pull back on a sink stretching distributes oxygen to where it's needed.
00:14:21 [W] That is to your brain because remember you are not being chased by a bear.
00:14:32 [W] You must take breaks from thinking about what is causing the stress put your attention somewhere else.
00:14:37 [W] Some people think is this is just a distraction.
00:14:40 [W] I consider it re focusing your attention on something else to restore your brain.
00:14:44 [W] I call it a brain break.
00:14:46 [W] Remember your emotions are linked to what you are paying attention to if you want to feel less anxiety take a break from the news social media from what you are working on if possible from ruminating about a difficult situation or conversation or feedback
00:15:01 [W] Whatever it is that's causing me. Anxiety. Your brain will have a chance to recover and allow you to approach the anxiety and a healthier state in most cases taking a 15 or 30 minute break will not lead to a total disaster, but it will
00:15:16 [W] Better it will still be there after your break schedule your brakes.
00:15:15 [W] Put it in your calendar stick to it. The way you would a critical meeting.
00:15:18 [W] This is a critical event.
00:15:20 [W] And when you are taking a break at 2:15 p.m.
00:15:24 [W] And those difficult anxiety-provoking thoughts come up, which they will expect it.
00:15:29 [W] They will just notice them and put them aside go back to attending to what you chose to do during your brain break. You can pick them back up and worry about them all.
00:15:39 [W] All the hard thoughts at 2:30 p.m.
00:15:41 [W] When you're scheduled break is over.
00:15:43 [W] The intention is not to take an indefinite break from important thoughts that need your attention.
00:15:50 [W] Brain break sound easier than they are.
00:15:53 [W] You have to practice start practicing now.
00:15:56 [W] Like most skills Brain Breaks require awareness.
00:16:00 [W] You must remember to take the break this might sound silly, but my experience has been that the awareness and remembering to take a break when you need it is the hardest part the bathroom mirror is your friend.
00:16:11 [W] I realize not Everyone likes having their personal mental health reminders on display for everyone else who uses the bathroom, but I believe that anyone any effort to bring more awareness to yourself will benefit everyone.
00:16:26 [W] Else your roommate partner kid Grandma.
00:16:29 [W] Like most skills Brain Breaks require awareness.
00:16:31 [W] You must remember to take the break this might sound silly, but my experience has been that the awareness and remembering to take a break when you need it is the hardest part the bathroom mirror is your friend.
00:16:42 [W] I realize not Everyone likes having their personal mental health reminders on display for everyone else who uses the bathroom, but I believe that anyone any effort to bring more awareness to yourself.
00:16:56 [W] If will benefit everyone else your roommate partner kid Grandma, how do you feel stress level 125 brake stretch, but there are also sticky notes phone reminders.
00:17:09 [W] I like the bathroom mirror because most of us use the bathroom a few times a day.
00:17:14 [W] So a few times a day, you can be reminded to check in with yourself to stretch ask if you need a break Etc, but there are a lot of other ways to set reminders
00:17:26 [W] Leslie breathe
00:17:28 [W] if you're going to take a break might as well use it to stretch.
00:17:31 [W] We focus your attention on something else other than what is causing your stress or just breathe.
00:17:36 [W] I include this one because it's pretty easy. But let's add a little more intentional breathing. The most recognized method of meditation is to pay attention to your breath. If you're paying attention to your breath, you're not attending to the growing list of tasks.
00:17:51 [W] breathe
00:17:53 [W] If you're going to take a break might as well use it to stretch. We focus your attention on something else other than what is causing your stress or just breathe.
00:18:00 [W] I include this one because it's pretty easy. But let's add a little more intentional breathing. The most recognized method of meditation is to pay attention to your breath. If you're paying attention to your breath, you're not attending to the growing list of tasks.
00:18:15 [W] ending so take a couple of deep breaths and observe the inhale and exhale and let's get the oxygen redirected from your muscles back into your brain because remember
00:18:27 [W] you are not being chased by a bear.
00:18:32 [W] So how many of you receive notifications on your computer?
00:18:37 [W] How about your phone?
00:18:40 [W] Or your Smartwatch make these notifications work for you. When you receive a notification use it as a reminder.
00:18:50 [W] close your eyes take a deep inhale and an exhale and then approach the notification.
00:18:56 [W] It's very unlikely that the five-second delay to do this.
00:18:59 [W] We'll have a damaging impact. It is very likely that it will prepare your brain to tackle the notification better.
00:19:07 [W] Notifications are your friend?
00:19:12 [W] So sleep stretch break and breathe.
00:19:18 [W] Lastly important to remember you must take breaks.
00:19:24 [W] You must take breaks.
00:19:27 [W] You must take breaks.
00:19:29 [W] You must take time off.
00:19:34 [W] And you are not alone.
00:19:35 [W] A lot of people are struggling right now in Tech and our society around the globe and it's okay that it's hard right now.
00:19:44 [W] First again, you are human and as isolated as you might feel or actually be right now you are not alone.
00:19:55 [W] Thank you Cube. Con cncf and each of you for joining me today.
00:19:59 [W] I look forward to hearing your questions.
00:20:01 [W] I don't have all the answers, but I will share what knowledge and insights I do have please. Feel free to email me or send a message in slack as well if that feels more comfortable. Thanks again.
00:20:22 [W] Hi everyone.
00:20:24 [W] Hope you can hear me.
00:20:25 [W] I am excited to answer some of your questions. If I do not get to your question. Please feel free to send it over slack or email me if I don't have time to get to it or
00:20:40 [W] Free of to cancer with the community nothing personal just let me know and we can chat further and yeah, thanks for joining me.
00:20:36 [W] I've checked out a few of these questions already.
00:20:39 [W] They're not surprising at all, and I'm excited to sort of reinforce what I just talked about.
00:20:46 [W] So just give me a second in between each to read them.
00:20:52 [W] How do you suggest we deal with separation between the work environment and home while working remotely?
00:20:58 [W] I guess it depends what you're trying to achieve my assumption based on this question is that it's hard to sort of context switch from being at work in an office where you're in work mode and at home where
00:21:14 [W] Mode so if you can try to set up anything close to that at home, it's probably going to benefit if that's what you're looking for.
00:21:15 [W] So the most ideal situation being you have an office where you work and you close the door and then when you're outside of your office, you are not working and you're being more intentional and mindful not to focus on work.
00:21:28 [W] I understand not everyone has that luxury and I work with a lot of people who are crammed into kitchen counters with their roommates and don't even
00:21:35 [W] have walls between them.
00:21:37 [W] So again, I think it takes a lot of intention and awareness around how you're spending your time.
00:21:44 [W] And where your brain space is being occupied and really working and practicing to have your mind and attention focused on work during certain time during certain hours
00:21:59 [W] I think it takes a lot of intention and awareness around how you're spending your time.
00:21:59 [W] And where your brain space is being occupied and really working and practicing to have your mind and attention focused on work during certain time during certain hours
00:22:32 [W] Not in those hours redirecting the attention that goes to work or anxieties or concerns about work or life in general that you need a break from back to something that's not related to those things.
00:22:45 [W] So again, it sounds really simple sounds like it should be really easy.
00:22:49 [W] It's not I've been practicing this stuff for years.
00:22:52 [W] It's still hard.
00:22:53 [W] It's even harder the harder The more stress. You have the more most overwhelming things are getting the harder it is to sort of access the
00:23:01 [W] these these helpful, you know hacks life hacks, but now is a good time to practice. So to answer more succinctly practice your awareness and be intentional about when and where you are
00:23:17 [W] Things are getting the harder. It is to sort of access these these helpful, you know hacks life hacks, but now's a good time to practice. So to answer more succinctly practice your awareness
00:23:49 [W] Work and not focus on work when you are in one place such as your home.
00:24:00 [W] This is a good one.
00:24:01 [W] I'd like to take a break, but my reality feels like a break is punished upon return all the work that was missed.
00:24:09 [W] Awaits us.
00:24:10 [W] How can we find the balance?
00:24:12 [W] Well, you're on the right track because finding the balance is what needs your focus and what a lot of people are disconnected from. So if that's already in your awareness, then the next step is to figure out how to achieve that balance and my experience
00:24:28 [W] Especially working with a lot of other people and Technology this comes down to boundaries.
00:24:34 [W] Like we discussed earlier technology is hugely demanding.
00:24:38 [W] There are extremely high expectations.
00:24:40 [W] If you are a yes person then you will spend could spend the rest of your life working 24/7 and basically existing in a state of fight or flight.
00:24:52 [W] So it's figuring out what that balance looks like is different for everyone, but we are always going to be asked more than what we are capable of doing and it's not
00:25:04 [W] We can say no always but we do need to practice that and when we can't say no and we have too much on our plates. We need to practice prioritizing and focusing on what we can and letting go of what we
00:25:19 [W] To be asked more than what we are capable of doing and it's not that we can say no always but we do need to practice that and when we can't say no and we have too much on our plates.
00:25:28 [W] We need to practice prioritizing and focusing on what we can and letting go of what we can't get to or our failures because they're coming. We're going to fail more.
00:25:39 [W] We're not going to get everything to everything. We're going to drop plates people are going to be upset with us. It's just
00:25:45 [W] Not manageable as far as in my experience in technology what can be demanded of us or what our expectations or the the industry's expectations of us.
00:25:58 [W] So we need to find balance and part of that is really focusing on our boundaries and doing the best we can and walking away saying I did what I can while still taking care of myself prioritizing that second piece as well
00:26:13 [W] I think that second piece is well and practice practice practice.
00:26:25 [W] You are exactly right.
00:26:26 [W] The stress is celebrated in Tech work.
00:26:28 [W] What do you suggest that an employee do to balance themselves? Even while constantly in the middle of a stressful work goes right back to breaks aside from sleep, which is the overarching really tried to reinforce that that is the one thing that needs your attention
00:26:43 [W] Focus on that if that is not in place, that is not going. Well.
00:26:48 [W] Other than that, you know finding the balance is is balancing the work by with what we need to restore which is a break.
00:27:00 [W] So if you are constantly a middle of stress 24/7, which I know most of you are then these brakes are critical and you need to start practicing now, they can be very short.
00:27:10 [W] You don't need a long luxurious three week.
00:27:12 [W] Parisian vacation, although we probably all do you need that as well?
00:27:17 [W] But we don't have the luxury to do that or can't right now for obvious reasons. So start taking little breaks throughout the days 15 minutes put it on your calendar do your best to refocus somewhere. Other than what you would normally ruminate
00:27:32 [W] When you are not actually in the you know, the stressful state of work and help your brain.
00:27:36 [W] He'll give yourself a break and it sounds really simple, but it will have a huge benefit. So start practicing now.
00:27:55 [W] Okay, what if I have my sleep and diet and check exercise manage notifications well, but still feel depressed and barely able to do any work sleep diet exercise notifications.
00:28:09 [W] Okay. My first thought is is how much are you working?
00:28:12 [W] If you have a stressful career and you're working more hours than your brain and body are you know capable of exerting cognitive energy around then there needs to be some balance.
00:28:24 [W] Around how much you're working and exerting yourself if you feel like you're meeting a reasonable workloads.
00:28:54 [W] if you've got that down and you're still feeling this way, and it has lasted for an extended period of time and there is nothing to point to as a possibility of why you might feel this way such as a pandemic or losing someone special in your life or you know
00:28:44 [W] Lead to depression. For example, then that's might be when you want to reach out and speak with someone just to get further information to get some advice of what direction to move.
00:29:01 [W] Is there any way to notice if others are stressed?
00:29:05 [W] Yeah, for some people it's really really obvious. And for some people it's not for some people you would never ever realize if your goal and part of the reason for asking this question is to help others.
00:29:17 [W] My recommendation is if you have the capacity to do this keep it simple.
00:29:23 [W] how are you doing are you doing okay?
00:29:27 [W] What do you need?
00:29:28 [W] Is there any way I can support you right now? That's it.
00:29:37 [W] So I'm not going to get through all these questions if the moderators could just shoot me a message when time is up to make sure I don't go over and if I don't get to your question again, please just email me or send it in in Slack.
00:29:57 [W] I recently started feeling.
00:29:59 [W] Is try to balance try to if you can't balance and you have to like we all have to go through periods where we a Sprint or we have to pull an all-nighter have really long hours one week, you know, that's fine.
00:30:10 [W] Make sure you recover from it, but it's not sustainable.
00:30:13 [W] So when I see working long hours, I say just re-evaluate, you know, making sure that that that's not something you're trying to sustain long-term and that it's balanced with something restorative which is, you know, focusing your attention.
00:30:28 [W] attention on something other than what is
00:30:32 [W] Using a lot of your brain space and causing stress. Anxiety Etc.
00:30:42 [W] So this is interesting in your perspective opinion. Do you think working in technology is good or indeed safe for people with anxiety or depression?
00:30:50 [W] I'm asking because for my own experience.
00:30:53 [W] There's quite a lot here.
00:30:54 [W] Okay, so you got the idea of the general question.
00:30:57 [W] Yeah.
00:30:58 [W] I don't want to judge it as being safe or unsafe good or bad.
00:31:01 [W] It's obviously different for every person as someone who has struggled with both anxiety and depression the way I look at being thrown into a situation that
00:31:11 [W] Some feel manageable is it's an opportunity to grow and it's a challenge and as is life and everything in front of us everything.
00:31:23 [W] I already struggle with anxiety and depression on my own.
00:31:27 [W] Let's give it a shot.
00:31:28 [W] Let's practice our boundaries and breaks and sleep and managing XY and z and see how it goes without any expectations if it's really really difficult for you and with your effort. You can't seem to
00:31:44 [W] Direction to where it feels healthy for you, you know then maybe it's not for you just and you can say this about anything in life anything activity and your relationship, right? If you're if you struggle in a relationships and you end up in a relationship with someone who's not healthy in
00:31:55 [W] Walk away and say no you can there's nothing wrong with that.
00:31:57 [W] Another option is saying let's give it a go.
00:31:59 [W] I'll work really hard on my end and see if this works out for me. And if it doesn't I can step back.
00:32:07 [W] So it's all an experiment and there's not a yes or no question for some of these harder questions.
00:32:12 [W] I know that can be frustrating.
00:32:17 [W] Oh, what do you do with a work schedule of 12 hours and even with that you cannot finish your pending tasks?
00:32:23 [W] Hello technology. This is it. This is the industry where in there will be endless tasks.
00:32:30 [W] There will be endless requests. We can work 20 hours a day and still not get to all of the tasks or be dropping plates.
00:32:38 [W] This is where you need to practice your boundaries.
00:32:40 [W] If you need help doing this, there are people out there like me coaches that helped coach.
00:32:47 [W] In these directions to improve these skills, but just know that it's not something you're doing wrong.
00:32:55 [W] There's always ways to improve the way you work. But this is this is sort of you know, one of the unique uniquenesses of Technology.
00:33:12 [W] There's a question about this cycle of Hope and let down basically around workloads.
00:33:17 [W] Personal life. Absolutely.
00:33:17 [W] The reality is is life is very disappointing.
00:33:19 [W] And again, this is one of those situations where 60 seconds left two minutes left.
00:33:27 [W] Okay.
00:33:27 [W] This isn't a I don't mean to sugarcoat hard situations, but this is a situation where you can approach it and see if you can work on your emotional regulation letting things go balancing the amount of time you spend worrying about work at work
00:33:42 [W] The life and maybe it's not for you, but it's either way.
00:33:41 [W] It's a good thing to practice because these things translate to other areas of life as well.
00:33:45 [W] Thank you so much for joining me today.
00:33:47 [W] I hope you found this valuable. Please shoot me a message in slack or email me so we can follow up on these other questions.
00:33:56 [W] Appreciate it. Have a good day.
