00:00:00 [W] Hello and welcome to the introduction to this cncf sig storage today.
00:00:06 [W] Or for cloudevents of storage. My name is Alex Kirk up and I'm the founder and CEO of storage or S. And one of the co-chairs of the Sig storage and I'm here with my
00:00:21 [W] Hi.
00:00:15 [W] thank you Alex for the introduction.
00:00:18 [W] My name is Aaron Boyd.
00:00:19 [W] currently work for apple and Cloud engineering and also the co-lead of the cncf storage state is Alex mentioned and Quinton is unable to join us today, but also serves as a co-lead is part of the cncf.
00:00:36 [W] Next slide. So today we want to cover quite a few areas around the cncf storage thing. We want to talk about what the state does how you can join help out also an overview of some of the storage projects
00:00:51 [W] Now within the cncf at incubation and graduation level will also take a look at a couple of the projects that are currently in review and then Alex is going to go into areas.
00:01:01 [W] We would like to see more projects participate in possible gaps in the landscape and overview of the cncf storage last Escape document that was published earlier this year and then overview of the performance and benchmarking document that has
00:01:16 [W] recently been published
00:01:14 [W] So what do we do with this thing?
00:01:18 [W] First of all, all of our meetings are open we meet twice a month on the second and fourth Wednesday of every month at 8 a.m.
00:01:24 [W] Pacific and you can see here several links to list out. What our Charter is who generally participates. It also has a link to the current conference call that we use every time
00:01:40 [W] That you can just bookmark that and then our agenda which is open for anyone to add.
00:01:37 [W] Items that they would like to discuss within that also within the agenda we try to keep very thorough meeting minutes and then there's the recordings. So if you have time and you want to go back, you're welcome to watch any of the
00:01:52 [W] Commuting and then lastly we would love for you to join the mailing list the mailing list. We send out information questions that may come up also links to the recording in the chamber when we're done with each one of the calls so
00:02:02 [W] So our calls that our membership are always open.
00:02:02 [W] We're completely transparent. So you have any questions or concerns? You can reach out to us through any of those names.
00:02:12 [W] So who is on the storage Sig?
00:02:15 [W] What is it comprised of so I would say currently the participants within the cncf storage.
00:02:21 [W] They are a very diverse group of both users and developers of cloud me their Technologies and we all have a strong storage folders and we're all leaders and early adopters many of us have been involved in kubernative since
00:02:36 [W] And have seen the progression of how storage has changed from being a technology where we pre provision volumes connected to them to dynamically provision to you know, adopting object storage for instance.
00:02:49 [W] And so we are organized into three different leads. All from different vendors are companies Alex myself and Quinton and then we have tech leads who are volunteers that help also review projects and do due diligence.
00:03:05 [W] Jean-Louis to go and then Sade Sade is also a Toc member.
00:03:10 [W] So he helps perform some of the TOC bees to the storage Sig as a liaison between the two.
00:03:16 [W] So what do we do what exactly is involved in our participation in the cncf storage space? So the idea of the Sig was to have
00:03:31 [W] subject matter experts in storage be able to review projects or talk to different projects and early adopters.
00:03:38 [W] So that the TOC could then scale those contributions in a way that they feel like were, you know review technically their due diligence was done on it and also be able to reach out to the end user Community for
00:03:54 [W] In that integrity and quality and therefore support the cncf mission.
00:03:50 [W] There are a multitude of projects that apply weekly monthly that want to be part of the cncf and it became a bottleneck to be able to review those bully.
00:04:02 [W] So the idea of the six was created separated out by different components within the cloud gate of landscape. And here we are with sorts it in the storage Sig was one of the first things to be created.
00:04:15 [W] And most of us had serves since then.
00:04:19 [W] So what we do as part of that mission is we educate we review the storage project proposals we engage with the user community and we work with Toc and other sins. So, what does that mean other
00:04:34 [W] Cross over these different lines.
00:04:27 [W] They don't meet into these nice little containers for upon so many times a project will come into the cncf and they will have a component of storage within that they might have a key value store.
00:04:41 [W] They might have a database its associated with it.
00:04:43 [W] it. So then we work with the other things to make sure that it's has a cloud native architecture it fits within the means of the mission and perform the due diligence necessary to make sure it's an appropriate.
00:04:55 [W] a project to be accepted
00:05:00 [W] So part of that end user education is publishing white papers and various other items that help educate our end users on how to select the best storage for the use case that they're wanting.
00:05:16 [W] then is publishing white papers and various other items that help educate our end users on how to select the best storage for the use paste that they're wanting to use
00:05:25 [W] use and adopt and so white papers presentations videos, all of these things are a form of training to better teach people new to kubernative sort of Moodle Cloud native or who may be coming from Legacy
00:05:40 [W] Change them. We try to develop generalized vendor free best practices around this. We try to create a common nomenclature of which we talk about different storage Technologies in different patterns and publish those out.
00:05:55 [W] That we can see the trends within the community within the wider landscape and help users make the best choices for what they're trying to accomplish.
00:06:03 [W] So the first one of those things that we published globally was the cncf storage right paper.
00:06:09 [W] It's on version 2 and the white paper is long, but it is extremely comprehensive in trying to net out. What are all the different components involved in traditional storage and also Within cncf
00:06:23 [W] see also within the cloud native landscape.
00:06:26 [W] What do those things mean? When we start running them in a cloud knative fashion?
00:06:30 [W] The second piece is the performance and benchmarking white paper for many people.
00:06:35 [W] It's critical to have a very performant file system or way of utilizing storage. And so this is our first pass.
00:06:46 [W] It'll be a version one to be able to articulate how we could do performance and Benchmark things within this cloud data plans.
00:06:53 [W] This is very different than it would be done in a normal traditional storage and then as much as possible, we provide that information and we publish it out to our users and we strive to be very vendor agnostic.
00:07:08 [W] Open and publish everything that we fund.
00:07:13 [W] And then part of the project review.
00:07:16 [W] There are within the cncf TOC. If you go into GitHub, you can see many of the different processes laid out.
00:07:24 [W] You'll see this nice little graph we have at the bottom published there as well.
00:07:29 [W] And so this shows how the Sig is involved in the review of many projects.
00:07:35 [W] and so are part of our job is to First identify to the cncf gaps that we see in the project portfolio, but then to also go
00:07:43 [W] To the current projects and make sure that they're still tracking where they should be.
00:07:48 [W] Ideally when projects are accepted into sandbox. The idea is that we see a viability of that project and we want to see it progressed through the different levels incubation and then graduation and so part of that
00:08:03 [W] Objects, but it's really projects moving from level to level and seeing if they're meeting the criteria from one to the next.
00:07:56 [W] It's also to perform Discovery and Outreach to different projects. We may hear of a project within the community or so may reach out to them.
00:08:05 [W] We have them come present on our bi-monthly meeting discuss the technology and then see if they're a good candidate for acceptance into the cncf at the different levels.
00:08:16 [W] We also help those candidate projects.
00:08:19 [W] So part of our job is not to be.
00:08:24 [W] The yes or no, let's say within these projects but part of it is to identify maybe where there's gaps and work with that project to help them remedy any issues that we might see that would prevent them from being part of you know incubation or graduating with project.
00:08:39 [W] We have the Project's assign its assigned to the Sig. We also then work through this process as you can see at the bottom to review it to provide a recommendation to the TOC. Once we have done that the TOC
00:08:51 [W] Review it to provide a recommendation to the TOC. Once we have done that the TOC agrees.
00:08:46 [W] They assign a sponsor from the TOC to drive that d Elegance and then put it up for public comment and then they vote on it and that's generally how project goes into incubation either through sandbox for incubation initially.
00:09:06 [W] We engage we really try to reach out to end users together their input and feedback regarding where they see pain points on either using these Technologies or integrating the Technologies into their roadmap.
00:09:21 [W] Primary use cases that they're using that technology we try to document that and gather that and we try to put that in a consumable report either that be a presentation or then into our white papers and new version and we try to include in
00:09:36 [W] You know, what is what are the different components of that technology that make it unique?
00:09:37 [W] Maybe it's the design of the architecture.
00:09:39 [W] Maybe it's ux but we try to capture all that information and publish it.
00:09:44 [W] We also try to enable the community are probably biggest thing is within our bimonthly meetings and taking those agenda and notes sending information out on the mailing list and keeping our Communications open and
00:09:59 [W] Obviously openly published and maintained and we're continually open the feedback those are living documents and we change them as they need to be done.
00:10:08 [W] And lastly, I believe we work as a trusted advisor to the TOC so many times the TOC is formed of limited number of people and depending on the year.
00:10:20 [W] There isn't always a representative who can speak to a subject matter expert level for storage.
00:10:28 [W] So the idea is well of having a storage Sig is to be able to be the trusted advisor to them to provide in-toto.
00:10:36 [W] Put in terms of how the project can scale if it adheres the cncf values and also the help of the project. So, you know, our role is to augment possibly the experience of the TOC
00:10:51 [W] A storage Sig is to be able to be the trusted advisor to them to provide input in terms of how the project can scale if it adheres the cncf values and also the help of
00:11:27 [W] And Community we kind of already went over this in a couple slides before but we really do want everyone to participate that wants to be here and you will see here within the link where you can submit and help review projects.
00:11:41 [W] Maybe you don't have anything that you want to bring forward, but you want to be involved in the process and have input we completely welcome that and they are openly published and can be commented on and you know,
00:11:55 [W] Though we're just have looked mainly it management Frameworks and block stores.
00:12:00 [W] You know, we're really focused on trying to get possibly more object stores in our databases. You know, the I don't feel like we're at the limit of what we can accept within the storage thing and there are many projects that have presented on the
00:12:15 [W] Of them listed here.
00:12:15 [W] You're welcome to go back through the meeting minutes of the agenda search for any one of these and find them reporting so that you can go learn more about these projects listed below.
00:12:26 [W] Yeah.
00:12:30 [W] Just just some small interjection to Echo the size of the passion we have for the community, you know, we're really diverse Community covering so the vendors and
00:12:44 [W] leads and containers from different projects as well. As you know, just independent contributors and we're the most exciting thing for us is to discover new projects and discover
00:12:59 [W] Switch which help the client knative storage environment. So, you know as Aaron said, please do propose your projects, and we'd love to hear from you.
00:12:55 [W] Absolutely.
00:12:57 [W] And so thus far as far as projects that have been incubating or graduating.
00:13:04 [W] Here's just some of the many Rook just recently graduated in the last few weeks.
00:13:08 [W] also the test at CD tikv, and then incubating is dragonfly. So there's plenty of room for other projects still to be part of the cncf storage thing.
00:13:23 [W] And so what wasn't mentioned on that slide as far as the levels is the cncf sandbox?
00:13:29 [W] So the sandbox process has changed dramatically within the past few years and the sandbox is meant to be in early stage to identify potential projects.
00:13:41 [W] That would be a good fit.
00:13:42 [W] But don't yet meet the criteria of incubation or graduation. So you can go to this link below look at the different sandbox projects are there.
00:13:50 [W] And then also look at how you can contribute your project as a Sandbox project. The idea though of the sandbox is truly to grow and cultivate the project into a viable incubation project. So
00:14:05 [W] Toc and the cigs are committed to helping projects get visibility that they need contributions and advice.
00:14:06 [W] So the current projects that we're reviewing for incubation is / Vega.
00:14:10 [W] You can learn more about them at the link below and then open EVS.
00:14:15 [W] Is that in sandbox for quite some time. They've applied to incubation and we're currently reviewing the criteria for that.
00:14:27 [W] You earned?
00:14:28 [W] Um, okay. So I'd also like to cover off some of the some of the work that the Sig has been doing on some of the papers that have been published that have we have published recently.
00:14:42 [W] We recently revised the cncf storage while paper with some additions. The version two of the white paper is is is there to explain the
00:14:57 [W] the variety in the cloud native storage landscaping and when we talk about storage and a client knative way, we're not talking about just storage systems in terms of volumes, but but in Deeds any way that you can
00:15:12 [W] in a client knative way so that includes, you know things like object stores and databases for example, and what's what when we when we first sat down to to put this white paper together, we
00:15:01 [W] and what's what when we when we first set out to to put this white paper together, we discovered that actually it's really important for end users to understand what their application needs and then to be able to translate that
00:15:06 [W] Lee it's really important for end users to understand what their application needs and then to be able to translate that to the the attributes of a storage system because in a climate of world
00:15:21 [W] knative world's developers get a much more active saying in what the storage system is and enrich storageos is of storage system to to use so so being able to understand the attributes of make up a story system is
00:15:35 [W] Persons as is understanding all the different layers in a storage solution as nowadays.
00:15:43 [W] There are a variety of layers that affect the virtualization or the integration with with an orchestrator and an understanding those those layers is also impactful to the the attributes of the storage system
00:15:58 [W] And understanding those those layers is also impactful to the the attributes of the storage system.
00:16:03 [W] And then finally, we review the different data access interfaces in terms of both volumes and apis and and also the definition of the management interfaces, so I've put in a little
00:16:19 [W] A little summary in the next couple of slides the cover off things like the data access interface which has which is the way that you that you persist or or access data in the system. We tended to group this in the white paper
00:16:33 [W] Buckets the the first being volumes, you know that can include traditional block devices fire systems or show file systems, and this can be over a variety of topologies whether it's local remote or
00:16:48 [W] Apologies as well as access of to storage via apis. So for example object stores or key value stores or different types of databases and although
00:17:00 [W] Used to determining attributes based on a different on different things access interfaces.
00:17:05 [W] Like I said, it's he's kind of important to understand the different typologies of those of those systems as often. The the way that you access storage is is not is not a good indicator of
00:17:20 [W] Storage is is not is not a good indicator of the attributes of the of the storage system.
00:17:25 [W] Secondly, of course in a cloud native worlds were we're looking at making the workloads declarative and composable in much the same way that with an
00:17:41 [W] Really, of course in a cloud native world where we're looking at making the workloads declarative and composable in much the same way that with an orchestrator like kubernative you're defining.
00:18:37 [W] You're finding things like the computer or the memory requirements for your applications with the different storage interfaces that that can that can apply CSI being the the
00:18:52 [W] Face being the standard for kubernative is interfacing with storage systems.
00:18:56 [W] You have the ability now to be declarative across your storage workloads and developers can Define in a declarative way the what they need out of their storage environment in terms of you know, the size of the
00:19:11 [W] in the declarative way the what they mean out of their storage environments in terms of you know, the size of the volumes or the different attributes that the storage system can support in terms of for example replication or
00:19:24 [W] I can support in terms of for example replication or data protection.
00:19:29 [W] for example, and it's it's it's key to understand that, you know, there are knative interfaces and also some Frameworks and tools that provide that provides these these projects with the ability to
00:19:44 [W] To provide the connectivity between the storage systems and the different container orchestrators.
00:19:50 [W] We talked about the storage attributes. We defined five key storage attributes that are important within the within the clinic to storage landscape when evaluating the different storage systems
00:20:06 [W] within the within the climate of storage landscape when evaluating the different storage systems that is those are availability scalability performance consistency and durability the key here is that
00:20:18 [W] Key here is that each storage system may have may have a number of different attributes and often attributes can be can cause compromises with different attributes.
00:20:32 [W] So for example, you know scalability and performance and consistency might have projects might have different optimizations in each of those in each of those attributes to hit different use
00:20:47 [W] for example systems that might be optimized for throughput might not be optimized for latency or systems that might be optimized for redundancy
00:21:02 [W] ability for example might not be optimized for throughput for example, so it's important to understand what your application needs and what the storage system can provide under the covers because there are a number of different ways of
00:21:12 [W] These attributes as are listed in on this on this page.
00:21:13 [W] We also talked about the different storage layers in a storage system and in an orchestrated environment, you will see that there are a number of different layers starting from the container and the container namespace
00:21:28 [W] Sir to the the difference topologies that might be implemented in the storage system whether it's centralized or distributed or sided with databases for example, or or or very common in nowadays different hyper-converged
00:21:42 [W] as well as the data protection capabilities which which have of course important important impacts on data Integrity as well, as you know, consistency and latency for example,
00:21:55 [W] The services that allow that allowed the flexibility within applications to provide snapshots for backups or data protection and replication for example, and then we mustn't forget the the physical and
00:22:07 [W] the physical underlying layers that this that ultimately the different storage services are persisting data on
00:22:16 [W] And then finally, we recently released our performance and benchmarking white paper.
00:22:24 [W] This was this was something which was our first offshoot from the cncf storage while paper where we said we're going to provide additional details on some of the attributes the first attribute
00:22:40 [W] Performance and the way we measure performance as that seemed to be a common question amongst end users.
00:22:47 [W] So in the in the white paper, we put some work together to Define some of the common concepts for measuring the performance and the benchmarking of volumes.
00:22:57 [W] What's important here is that you know, we made a decision not to specifically assess the performance ourselves, but this is more about providing.
00:23:09 [W] Being end users with the information to be able to assess the performance of their own systems and and and understands the the attributes of their own systems, whether it's you know storage on volumes or storage and databases which were
00:23:24 [W] Two areas that we decided to focus on as we were putting the paper together we discovered that actually a lot of the challenges where around the setting, you know, the common pitfalls and considerations that
00:23:30 [W] When people are benchmarking systems, and it's it's it's definitely safe to say that Apples to Apples comparisons are extremely complicated in the storage World.
00:23:34 [W] There are lots of lots of factors that can affect performance everything from things like compression or different caching or different physical infrastructure or different virtualization parameters.
00:23:50 [W] Mission parameters or even things like, you know encryption and and other types of data protection can affect can dramatically affect the performance of different systems.
00:23:58 [W] So ultimately we decided to to make sure that all of this is a numerator with and in an easy to understand way and we provided some sample tools. So that end users can run their own benchmarks and
00:24:14 [W] The attributes of their own system.
00:24:15 [W] Here's the most important takeaway.
00:24:17 [W] It is completely useless to compare vendor published results, you know, if you're looking at iops or transactions per second or megabytes per second or whatever it is.
00:24:31 [W] It is hard to impossible to compare the published results without actually understanding the specific test conditions. So what we always recommend is that end users run
00:24:43 [W] their own tests on their own storage in their own environment so that they can understand how their particular environment behaves with their storage environments and that ultimately gives them a better understanding and the
00:24:58 [W] Other better capability of figuring out what their application needs and what their application demands are and that's it with that.
00:25:03 [W] We finish our presentation and we love to hear questions and we'll be hoping will be will be online to take questions and and hear any comments.
00:25:24 [W] Hello, so, so, this is Alex and Aaron. We're here to take your questions. If you have any questions, please enter them in the in the question box in the left hand corner of the video session.
00:25:39 [W] We do have we do have a question around whether the cncf Sig storage file dates or checks conformance of CSI is delivered by by vendors.
00:25:45 [W] Aaron do you want to take this one?
00:25:39 [W] Sure, I'd be happy to so basically no, we don't do any sort of conformance testing.
00:25:46 [W] We are providing framework as Alex mentioned in his section of the presentation around benchmarking and performance.
00:25:53 [W] So we more provide a scientific way of evaluating storage in different use cases as guidelines, but we don't do any sort of certification or validation against any vendor
00:26:08 [W] all times very vendor agnostic
00:26:11 [W] Yeah, go ahead Alex's just just just adding to that. It's probably worth pointing out to the Sea Side project themselves have have some built-in CSI sanity tests.
00:26:26 [W] Some any of the vendors who are developing drivers can use to to validates that their driver means the spec. So today it's the vendors and the storage systems
00:26:37 [W] effectively using using that process
00:26:38 [W] great Point.
00:26:39 [W] Thank you.
00:26:40 [W] I'll read the next question Alex if you want to take it where can I download the slide?
00:26:44 [W] I don't see it in schedule, you know, we will update this list. We will upload a slide deck into the into the into shade. I'm really sorry. We must have missed doing that before but
00:26:59 [W] Can't into the into shade. I'm really sorry. We must have missed doing that before but we will do right now. Sorry about that.
00:27:11 [W] So we're reading the next question.
00:27:19 [W] Excellent.
00:27:21 [W] You want to take this one Alex?
00:27:22 [W] Give me to read it and you can answer it.
00:27:24 [W] Sure.
00:27:25 [W] So Stefan was asking the white papers look great. But is alone Kate's administrator.
00:27:31 [W] It's hard for me to find time to read a 42 Page Plus 18 page white paper.
00:27:38 [W] I completely understand are there shorter or executive summaries available?
00:27:44 [W] So that's that's a good question.
00:27:46 [W] What you'll find is sick has done a number of summaries in a number of presentations, which you'll find in the cncf blogs and in cncf webinars, which are probably really useful summaries.
00:28:01 [W] But also I think you'll find that the white paper is split into useful sections so you can focus on the area that that you may be interested in right? So, I think it's generally important
00:28:17 [W] Standing of the attributes, but then you can focus in on the specific storage area, you know, whether it's file systems or databases or object stores for example, and just focus in on those sorts of areas another great thing and I can't
00:28:25 [W] please also joined the the sickening things and you know, ask questions and join the mailing list and you'll find the community that is that is there and happy to help and just on that point with
00:28:39 [W] Like to welcome, you know people from the audience and people like that that are listening in to to joining the Sig and maybe even volunteer as as tech leads,
00:28:52 [W] Our interventions doing really important roles in the cncf around project reviews and and due diligence which which really help the community and make those cncf so much stronger
00:29:08 [W] And just to add to that I think it's really important for both Alex and I to really educate administrators About Storage. I think it sometimes is a gap and a secondary thought
00:29:24 [W] The documentation is pretty exhaustive.
00:29:24 [W] We hope that it can help you make an educated decision when you're looking at your different options about running applications with persistence associated with them.
00:29:33 [W] But yes, we're we're always available mailing list slack Community meetings. All three of those were very receptive taking any questions you have about specific use cases that you're looking at in need assistance in making technology choices or
