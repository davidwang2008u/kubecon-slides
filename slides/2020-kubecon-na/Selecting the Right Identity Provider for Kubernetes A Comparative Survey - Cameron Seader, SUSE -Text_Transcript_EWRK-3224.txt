00:00:00 [W] Hi, I'm Cameron Cedar.
00:00:02 [W] And in this session. We are going to talk about selecting the right identity provider for kubernative use a comparative survey.
00:00:10 [W] Many many of their premium customers accounts and strategic opportunities.
00:00:18 [W] I've worked in this industry for many many years and have lots of experience in many different areas and hopefully today you can get some good information from some of the experiences that I've had working with kubernetes
00:00:33 [W] Riders
00:00:35 [W] So who do you trust in this ever-evolving web identities? I hope to be able to talk about identities the where why how and digs and identity providers for kubernative
00:00:51 [W] Ugly what identity providers are available.
00:00:51 [W] and what are the common markers of interest?
00:00:54 [W] And also what common marker comparison is available today and how we can conclude on the right identity provider for me.
00:01:06 [W] So let's talk about identities now identities have gone through lots of evolution over the past few decades.
00:01:13 [W] But if you think back from the invention of the transistor to having billions of those transistors in the palm of your hand today think about what it took as a community to come together
00:01:29 [W] Each such invention and we're mostly throughout time have been creating kind of our own problems and unique Solutions and it's all through community Through Time
00:01:40 [W] Have really changed the world and if you think about identities in the way that we've evolved to having applications running on top of our cell phone our identity
00:01:48 [W] Has changed in ways that we never even thought possible.
00:01:50 [W] So being able to overcome challenges such as providing authentication for different types of applications that are running on our phone and maybe having that application touch.
00:02:06 [W] Different identities or even gather information from our identity that might be common information that could be used between other applications.
00:02:16 [W] So it's kind of interesting how we've kind of helped perfect that so by way of communities and Technology. We're kind of becoming more perfectionist in this way.
00:02:32 [W] And there's two things now that that really kind of stand out and and really have evolved and that's authentication and authorization.
00:02:40 [W] So in terms of authentic, which is authentication and then all the Z, which is authorization.
00:02:47 [W] there's a few different strategies here.
00:02:49 [W] So with all thin you typically have client certificates or SSL or some type of token whether it be a static token an open idea.
00:03:02 [W] Connect to open web hook tokens bootstrap tokens service account tokens. And these are very common amongst kubernative itself.
00:03:13 [W] You could also have a static password or some type of anonymous request. If it's temporary in AWS is easy terms. There are a few different strategies. We've gone back and forth between our back which is role-based Access Control.
00:03:28 [W] Z which is authorization. There's a few different strategies here.
00:03:29 [W] So with all thend you typically have client certificates or SSL or some type of token whether it be a static token an open ID connect token webhook tokens.
00:04:54 [W] Or a back or authors other ization control web Hooks and also node authorization authorization.
00:05:07 [W] We also need to compare things like different protocols.
00:05:11 [W] So we have things like Sample versus oauth and oid see which is open ID connect and what's interesting over time.
00:05:24 [W] Samuel has been very popular amongst identity providers in the past where you just look up an identity and
00:05:35 [W] See if that user is able to authenticate based on a password or token of sorts, but now we've kind of moved into this world of using oauth and
00:05:50 [W] Were open identity connect and this methodology combining those two together gives you the best of both worlds because you the ability to move out the negate and
00:06:05 [W] So very early on a lot of these use cases just really used sam'l Authentication.
00:06:03 [W] And because that's really what was all that was required.
00:06:07 [W] Oh off to Plus open ID connect gives us even more powerful capabilities to be able to do them several ways plus some
00:06:22 [W] these in also be able to use those in the mobile environment and also providing access to various types of resources if you think around the time when
00:06:34 [W] You know pop up in Mobile phones there became the idea of well, I need my identity.
00:06:35 [W] Plus I need to be able to capture, you know contacts may be from Google and so I need to be able to connect that to maybe an application like Yelp and so having open ID
00:06:51 [W] Working together gave us that capability if you see the little the picture on the right, that's a kind of a the common connection there. We were able to connect our applications to these
00:07:06 [W] Common connection there. We were able to connect our applications to these various applications and provide some authorized information to that application
00:07:17 [W] um, and that's still goes on today in many applications use that use that capability which makes it a lot more powerful and we're going to see more of that of course,
00:07:33 [W] ATC and oauth to infinity and beyond maybe so we have our then we've got Ozzy we've got that seemingly level but figured out but it is complex.
00:07:46 [W] It's not something that you just go and start using you have to learn how it works.
00:07:54 [W] You've got to learn how to program before oauth and øâëç so for developers, it can be very complex.
00:08:03 [W] Is it don't really want or care for managing tokens or cryptography, but they want to be able to authenticate users and check their access. And so they need some sort of client Library
00:08:18 [W] Hopper's it can be very complex.
00:08:18 [W] You don't really want or care for managing tokens or cryptography, but they want to be able to authenticate users and check their access.
00:08:29 [W] And so they need some sort of client Library.
00:08:33 [W] more in order to make that possible make it really easy. It's important to bundle in some type of client library for developers so that they can do this really simple easily.
00:08:45 [W] Yeah.
00:08:48 [W] Now you have the kubernative way of authenticating which is fairly straightforward.
00:08:55 [W] You have authentication.
00:08:57 [W] you've got authorization and then you have the admission control that all takes place within the kubernative flustered now kubernative provides several different plugins, and there's also the the basic authentication as well,
00:09:13 [W] Kubernative provides several different plugins and there's also the basic authentication as well, which is all base64 encoded and then there's also I open ID connect and it also has the ability to
00:09:29 [W] The ldap and several types of token authentication and you can go on on Counting the different ways.
00:09:37 [W] So there's lots of possibilities there.
00:09:40 [W] if you want to scale that, of course you need I'm not an identity provider or some other methodology of plug into that and that's why we have the different plugins.
00:09:54 [W] So identity private providers for kubernative a
00:09:59 [W] this is kind of a typical identity provider architecture when it comes to kubernative.
00:10:05 [W] This is what I see a lot of people doing and you'll see this, you know, very commonly for out-of-the-box solutions for kubernative distributions where you have an ldap store that has your
00:10:20 [W] When it comes to kubernative, this is what I see a lot of people doing and you'll see this, you know, very commonly for out-of-the-box solutions for kubernative distributions where you have an ldap
00:10:45 [W] You have various users and passwords Etc.
00:10:49 [W] And you'll typically use Dex another one might be UAA, but Dex will provide the ability for you to plug in with Opa night with
00:11:04 [W] But Dex will provide the ability for you to plug in with Opa night with open with.
00:11:11 [W] Oh I DC or use some type of other authenticator such as gangway in order to provide login credentials and the up the
00:11:26 [W] You provide login credentials and the the authentication and authorization tokens and to do it in an easy fashion and to really provide it in a way that can make things
00:11:42 [W] a little more extensible
00:11:47 [W] So do we really still need ldap in 2020?
00:11:50 [W] Well, that's a really good question. And it really might depend on your use case.
00:11:58 [W] It's been proven its tell that's been around for a long time in the Enterprise.
00:12:03 [W] It's easy to do migrations from other identity providers into all that it's used as a base for a lot of unified single sign-on the solutions and you may already have it.
00:12:16 [W] Somewhere in your Enterprise and it's Deployable and kubernative Ace. Now the negative side to that is the declarative side of it is is not always sufficient and it's
00:12:31 [W] So you really better make a backup or you might have some type of way to synchronize it which may not always be possible which also doesn't scale very well also in
00:12:45 [W] Possible which also doesn't scale very well also in an ldap sense scale-out methodology is just not there if you want to do, you know thousands of logins per second.
00:12:53 [W] you know thousands of logins per second that's really hard to scale with with ldap and it's not typically usable as in so you have to do a lot of modifications
00:13:08 [W] So you have to do a lot of modifications and you have to set up your configuration file for SSL and various other things and you don't get any two-factor authentication.
00:13:22 [W] And so you might want to use something like a nosql database like couchbase.
00:13:29 [W] for example that help provide an ldap interface, but yet is able to scale out.
00:13:38 [W] both in a cloud native perspective or on-premise
00:13:48 [W] Now portals to the rescue portals to another identity provider if you are using Dex or UAA, you can use these other oid see
00:14:04 [W] There's the gay way which I just showed in the in the architecture example, or you have the Dex kubernative.
00:14:14 [W] zop indicator, which is also available and there's lots and lots of others. I believe when you Google search it you'll see at least two dozen different types of oit see clients that you could possibly plug-in with Dex or
00:14:29 [W] As as a use with kubernative, but these don't always scale.
00:14:28 [W] They don't they're not always capable of providing thousands of connections a second.
00:14:37 [W] So if you want something that is used both for your kubernative Administration and for your applications that are running on kubernative. He's been this is
00:14:50 [W] Will not the solution for you.
00:14:54 [W] And there's the outstanding in the crowd and these are the ones that actually have some real open source street cred and we have glue which their goal is to be among the first vendors
00:15:09 [W] Probably not the solution for you.
00:15:09 [W] And there's the outstanding in the crowd and these are the ones that actually have some real open source street cred and we have glue which their goal is to be among the first vendors
00:15:37 [W] All of the new essential features of oauth and they didn't really oppressive impressive job of that.
00:15:49 [W] And then there's key cloak which is also open source.
00:15:52 [W] It's driven more so by Red Hat Community.
00:15:58 [W] it's open source, identity and access management for modern applications and services and we have open Unison, which is combining the the common identity management functions
00:16:13 [W] Even more so by Red Hat Community.
00:16:17 [W] It's open source, identity and access management for modern applications and services and we have open Unison, which is combining the the common identity management functions
00:16:58 [W] most applications including single sign-on user provisioning Federation web services and open Unison can run on any j2ee containers such as tom cat or JBoss and then we have open
00:17:13 [W] Which started in 2008 with this mission of making the business of managing identities effortless using Innovative approach?
00:17:23 [W] So they all really have similar goals, but they their technology differs slightly in implementation.
00:17:33 [W] So let's take a look at some of that a little bit some of the common markers of interest that that I want to pay attention to our identity.
00:17:42 [W] A federation open source, because if you remember when I talked about earlier going back to the treatment transistors and how those came about and how we now have Trend billions of
00:17:58 [W] but I want to pay attention to our identity Federation open source, because if you remember when I talked about earlier going back to the tree and transistors and how those came about and how we
00:18:24 [W] Screws in the palm of our hand.
00:18:27 [W] It's always been about Community to bring that about so when you take a look at open source open source makes a big difference in the way that we Implement and provide
00:18:42 [W] The software if you look at the way that oauth has formed to be able to tackle these solutions from applications on our phone.
00:18:52 [W] It was a community of users that came together to create Olaf and you know find solutions to these problems will also look at protocol support for authentic
00:19:08 [W] Different types of second Factor authentication ways of doing user management.
00:19:13 [W] Do we have automated client registration?
00:19:16 [W] do we have different types of back-end support so we can do scale out and support up to thousands of users per second.
00:19:25 [W] what types of languages are we writing this application and let's look at the healthy markers of a
00:19:35 [W] Ella perk immunity and and do we make it easy and Deployable on top of kubernative?
00:19:44 [W] So what's best for me?
00:19:47 [W] Let's go ahead and compare these if we look at these markers that we talked about from a key cloak perspective.
00:19:54 [W] Yes, identity Federation is comparable across the board every single one of these Solutions does provide identity proof Federation. Now, what's really not
00:20:10 [W] Is whether or not that identity Federation is provided as an Enterprise Edition version and you have to pay extra or it just comes completely free in this case of glue.
00:20:19 [W] You'll notice that a lot of the features. In fact everything that you see is what you get.
00:20:27 [W] It's 100% open source, everything that is provided in the open source version is also in the Enterprise version.
00:20:35 [W] In the Enterprise version, you're just paying for support and if you need help and setting it up or you know, it's your insurance. You can call glue get great support. They'll help you out with with anything in regards to the software.
00:20:50 [W] Everything that you see is what you get.
00:20:42 [W] It's 100% open source, everything that is provided in the open source version is also in the Enterprise version in the Enterprise version.
00:20:51 [W] You're just paying for support and if you need help and setting it up or you know, it's your insurance. You can call glue get great support they'll help you out with with anything in regards to the software and getting
00:21:45 [W] Get set up and sit and getting a solution to put together.
00:21:50 [W] That's what they provide. They are 100% an open source solution when you take a look at Key cloak or open Unison or or open. I am all of these have some differentiators when
00:22:05 [W] An Enterprise version of the product because they will offer certain extensions to a that provide extra functionality that you don't get in the open source version.
00:22:20 [W] The functionality that you don't get in the open source version.
00:22:18 [W] So you'll see some differences there as far as you know, you'll see in some of the documentation.
00:22:26 [W] Oh, well, this Enterprise version will support these extra protocols.
00:22:34 [W] So if you look at our the protocol support, they're pretty common across the board.
00:22:41 [W] You'll notice that glue does prodyna.
00:22:44 [W] Provide some extra stuff there.
00:22:46 [W] It's got some Integrations with Opa open policy agent Kuma and Kaz, which key cloak does have some of that too. But some of that stuff does have a cost to it on the Enterprise version.
00:23:01 [W] Some extra stuff there.
00:23:02 [W] It's got some Integrations with Opa open policy agent Kuma and Kaz, which key cloak does have some of that too. But some of that stuff does have a cost to it on the Enterprise version.
00:23:30 [W] So you have to pick and choose what you like better you like the pure open source version or you know D like to have something that's a
00:23:45 [W] your
00:23:46 [W] there's the second Factor authentication if you compare all these they all have similar functionality there, you know from the totp or the OTP
00:24:02 [W] To where you're supporting extra devices that you might like to use with the u2f functionality and some of them only provide that functionality
00:24:14 [W] addition for user management
00:24:18 [W] They're all pretty common and some of those interfaces are better than others.
00:24:22 [W] So if you take a look at Key cloak really like their interface, it's really user friendly.
00:24:28 [W] And what's really nice is it comes with the CLI CLI is super nice for administrators. If you come from the command line World, whereas the others don't really provide that glue provides a really nice
00:24:43 [W] What's really nice is it comes with the CLI CLI is super nice for administrators. If you come from the command line World, whereas the others don't really provide that glue provides a really nice interface as well as open Unison
00:25:01 [W] Is as well as open Unison, their interfaces are all very very similar.
00:25:06 [W] They're very nice and easy to work with very user friendly as far as user management goes for managing, you know, having user management being able to manage it themselves going in and changing passwords
00:25:22 [W] Sure, they all have the similar types of interfaces very user-friendly.
00:25:29 [W] Automated client registration all built in with every one of those Solutions and again their web interface or interfaces in order to accomplish that are all very capable and very user friendly very
00:25:44 [W] As far as back in support goes most every one of them will support your active directory is back in ldap tight back ends anything available there if it's edirectory, it's all going to work there.
00:25:54 [W] There's other possible and some of these like key cloak will have some others possible.
00:26:00 [W] They also say you can support some type of databases as well. But your mileage may vary as far as whether that whether that's easy to integrate.
00:26:11 [W] Eight or it's easy to follow through some documentation glue makes it super easy.
00:26:17 [W] It's all integrated with their deployment tools.
00:26:20 [W] You can deploy either with an ldap service or you can deploy with couchbase and it will go through some level of Gateway synchronization. If you want to connect it to active directory and other services open use it
00:26:35 [W] In glue makes it super easy.
00:26:33 [W] It's all integrated with their deployment tools.
00:26:36 [W] You can deploy either with an ldap service or you can deploy with couchbase and we'll go through some level of Gateway synchronization. If you want to connect it to active directory and other services open use it
00:27:04 [W] Similar things as well where it can do that with Mongo DB but I've noticed that as far as easily deployed, I would I would really give hands down to glue as far as easy to Floyd.
00:27:19 [W] Because that's built into all the helm charts and it just makes it super easy hoop open. I am takes a lot more configuration and those kubeflow takes a little bit of extra configuration on that side of the house to
00:27:34 [W] Loosely delivered in a Java development framework and some arm mostly supported on top of things like JBoss or some type of middleware that might not be
00:27:45 [W] Things like JBoss or some type of middleware that might not be true amongst all of them open Unison certainly is not open. I am certainly not but some level of j2ee so you might require some
00:27:57 [W] Require some type of Tomcat in order exit executed if it's deployed through the helm charts the Nats typically going to be taken care of for you develop
00:28:12 [W] Ladies and all these are pretty well active open. I am can't really find a lot of information on on their their Community develop more.
00:28:22 [W] that's really located seems like some of it was was in it get of and maybe it moved somewhere else, but it's difficult to find especially information on their road map glue is pretty active.
00:28:37 [W] You'll see issues and things and activity going on.
00:28:42 [W] On a daily basis. They have a current road map available open Unison the same way a pretty active.
00:28:50 [W] I didn't find any, you know, Act of road map available there, but I'm sure that they have stuff available. If you ask them key cloak pretty active community no real active.
00:29:05 [W] But I could see from the community, but they're pretty active Community from a daily basis with issues there resolving from a weekly basis.
00:29:14 [W] So their Community seems pretty active there as far as the architecture goes the architecture differs on many of the on all four of really
00:29:30 [W] as far as the architecture does the architecture differs on many of the on all four of really you're going to see a mix of you know, client libraries that are provided and
00:29:29 [W] Mix of you know client libraries that are provided and you know, some client libraries mixed with some open source client libraries, you'll find you know, a very
00:29:45 [W] Worried that glue is provided but it's a glue Centric Library so you can but they provide this extra client library that you can program to to make things really easy from a developer's perspective
00:30:00 [W] Blue also have support for many different languages Key Club has some extra support for languages as well open.
00:30:07 [W] I am I'm not quite sure about but they do provide some client libraries that are common with some common apis and then of course making this available for all, you know, kubernative.
00:30:22 [W] Easy to deploy making Helm charts available.
00:30:24 [W] I think glue as far as providing all that but also making it super easy to configure and set up for many different scenarios glue has that down pretty well,
00:30:40 [W] The easy Road there. They do pretty well there and then if you want something as certified, I found this to be quite interesting from a certain own Opa night.
00:30:48 [W] Excuse me, an open ID certification goes you can go out to open ID and check out the certified open ID providers servers and services whereas glue has the glue server for DOT X
00:31:03 [W] He cloak is certified.
00:31:05 [W] Although I was noticing that was a little bit older version.
00:31:08 [W] So they're not quite up to date there.
00:31:10 [W] There's also the Certified Financial grade API and the glue server for DOT to is completely certified.
00:31:19 [W] That's the newest version.
00:31:20 [W] There's also the Certified Financial grade API for the client initiated back-channel authentication profile, which again is
00:31:32 [W] another certification for Igloo server for point to I'm not seeing any other of these these idps these identity providers that actually have
00:31:47 [W] Enter any involvement in the open ID certifications there except blue.
00:31:49 [W] I think they're making a big point to make sure that each one of theirs is completely certified.
00:31:55 [W] Although others have made attempts and there are others out there, you know, they've just been small attempts and they're typically older versions.
00:32:07 [W] But I can just use Dex or you a yeah, you could but I'm going to tell you it's just really for those Solutions where you might be more localized Solutions.
00:32:18 [W] not a lot of users might be for just a ministration of your kubernative cluster.
00:32:23 [W] It's definitely not going to be for your use case when it involves your applications and you want to build an authentication mechanism for your application stack that you have running their own kubernative. You really want her will
00:32:36 [W] Something that's more of an identity provider that you can utilize and scale out.
00:32:43 [W] Give a nice scale out architecture for thousands of users a second depending on your requirements there. But then there's UAA.
00:32:54 [W] UAA is also possible that you have some similar capabilities there with Dex but you're still going to require a client application and there's no sir.
00:33:06 [W] vacations with either of these when it comes to the open ID certifications
00:33:11 [W] But I will tell you it's just really for those Solutions where you might be more localized Solutions.
00:33:09 [W] not a lot of users might be for just a ministration of your kubernative cluster.
00:33:14 [W] It's definitely not going to be for your use case when it involves your applications and you want to build an authentication mechanism for your application stack that you have run in there on kubernative.
00:33:25 [W] You really will want something that's more of an identity provider that you can
00:33:32 [W] utilize and scale out.
00:33:35 [W] Give a nice scale out architecture for thousands of users a second depending on your requirements there. But then there's UAA.
00:33:45 [W] UAA is also possible that you have some similar capabilities there with Dex but you're still going to require a client application and there's no certifications with either of these when it comes to
00:36:15 [W] In conclusion, I really like to go with the outstanding in the crowd and it's really because of the the certifications It's really because the community involvement
00:36:31 [W] In the community that's going on one that really stands out to me as glue because they've really gone the extra mile to get certified.
00:36:38 [W] They've gone the extra mile to make everything 100% open source and Upstream.
00:36:45 [W] They're focused on their Community.
00:36:46 [W] They're focused on making sure it's open source, but focused on the Open Standards making sure it's enterprise-ready making sure you're innovating focusing on all these oh, oh
00:37:00 [W] with policies and standards various administrator tools that are available and also developer tools from development perspective perspective making sure that you have client libraries available.
00:37:16 [W] Making sure that you're covering the whole protocol base that's out there because you know, there's going to be some applications that you might just want to use sam'l off with another's you might want to use open.
00:37:27 [W] Oh I DC and oauth and it's common and you might see it very soon 0:03. I think they're working on it now. They're working on some different.
00:37:42 [W] Scopes there.
00:37:43 [W] There's still problems, right?
00:37:44 [W] There's still the community coming together trying to fix solutions to fix problems and come up with solutions to those problems in the community today, and we're going to see more changing in that direction, but
00:38:00 [W] You things continue to evolve around?
00:37:53 [W] oh ATC and oauth as we move forward and just enhancing that making those things better.
00:38:00 [W] Hopefully this was useful and and hopefully enjoyed some of the content certainly leave some feedback. And and I'd like to hear more reach out to me.
00:38:11 [W] I'm on Twitter.
00:38:12 [W] I'm on LinkedIn and we'll talk to you soon.
00:38:16 [W] Thanks. Bye.
00:38:27 [W] All right. I think we've got a short amount of time to do some QA.
00:38:33 [W] So there's some good questions that came through actually, so I just want to point out. I did change the slide slightly after I gave this for did the recording there's
00:38:49 [W] David slide deck in the keuken schedule.
00:38:43 [W] So if you go out there you can download the latest version.
00:38:46 [W] It's in a PDF format.
00:38:48 [W] There's some slight adjustments to some of the details on comparison slide and there's a few additions made their along the lines with open Unison.
00:39:01 [W] So I've had some direct conversations with the CTO over at open Unison and some graphql.
00:39:08 [W] Direct experience installing both of several of these platforms.
00:39:13 [W] So let me just go through some of these questions really quickly because we don't have a lot of time but I'm happy to stay connected on the slack Channel. If you go out to the coop Comm 101 section,
00:39:29 [W] Of the see I'm in there undersea Cedar.
00:39:20 [W] that's my user ID and we can chat there as well.
00:39:27 [W] So from the looks of the questions of getting one that says When developing s Pas single page application under what circumstances you recommend using a back in for for front end as opposed to an opcode flow and this
00:39:42 [W] Be answered simply in terms of its depending on how your platform is been designed.
00:39:43 [W] Are you expanding and growing the platform?
00:39:46 [W] How many users are you targeting?
00:39:47 [W] What's what type of users are you targeting? If the answers to those questions are you're targeting a very large user base and you're planning on expanding this platform.
00:39:59 [W] You certainly want to back in environment to start with so you can make it easier for yourself making a sysdig.
00:40:04 [W] You to grow that environment so you have to you don't have to concentrate on maintaining off code and flowmill time.
00:40:11 [W] There's a lot of these tools that are built right in to these platforms that can make that really simple and easy for you.
00:40:18 [W] Another question was key cloak does have a road map. So I wasn't actually aware that we're aware of where that was.
00:40:30 [W] So then odd, you know posted that to the questions there.
00:40:35 [W] I'll post that out to the slack Channel Make sure everybody knows where that is.
00:40:39 [W] But he's also asking to share the links and resources for key cloak I'll make sure I'll get those posts into the slack channel. So, you know where to pick those up
00:40:54 [W] The question here that talks about what's the difference between kubeflow kin glue?
00:40:56 [W] So the difference between key cloak and glue is really it all comes down to some of the tooling that they provide in between the two differences the differences between the two from what I've seen
00:41:11 [W] Stating they have a difference in platform for managing users be able to do simple authentication with kubernetes environment open Unison has something very similar as well.
00:41:25 [W] usually in fact open Unison probably makes it the easiest that I've seen to do a medication directly to to a kubernetes environment if you're like a kubernative
00:41:37 [W] Keep that abstraction little bit different as opposed to you know, conglomerate it with your the authentication for users in your applications.
00:41:46 [W] Let's see as far as Key Club. There's also some differences there as far as some of the supported protocols.
00:42:00 [W] They're mostly the same. I think there's some differences when it comes to the Enterprise version that
00:42:07 [W] that they offer on the Enterprise which is paid for versus what some of the other ones like open Unison and glue offer, you know standard in their platform as being a hundred percent open source.
00:42:24 [W] Let's see.
00:42:28 [W] Open Unison does have some flexibilities when it comes to being kind of a kind of a proxy authentication proxy for
00:42:43 [W] Armament if you remember the slide where I talked about, you know connections with UAA and Dex and open Unison has the ability to to plug in as well
00:42:57 [W] kubernative sin that way
00:42:55 [W] so in that way, it can be very powerful.
00:42:57 [W] So if you wanted to start out with something very simple you could and then you could expand it and grow from there and also add on any other types of identity provider tools that you required for your application stock
00:43:12 [W] With it so that to me that makes sense. As far as installation setup goes I would have to say that the absolute easiest one that I that I worked with was probably open Unison
00:43:27 [W] Is pretty close but as far as easiest goes open Unison was absolutely the easiest to stand up and get running blue has a really nice installation tool, but it had very specific requirements for
00:43:43 [W] for storage and some other things that you may not have in your environment that typically don't see a lot of people actually having so like open EBS and some other things that
00:43:59 [W] You know, of course, you could probably hack-a-thon has to make it work with some other storage back ends, but it seemed a little bit more difficult from the experience that I had with it, and it's got some
00:44:15 [W] Different deployment configurations that you can choose from with its can with its deployment tool.
00:44:22 [W] There's a question in here.
00:44:26 [W] What would you run if you still needed to supply a local ldap and point?
00:44:31 [W] So if I need to supply a local ldap and point I would probably just use ldap just to make it simple for yourself. It's if it's just going to be for local.
00:44:44 [W] Occasion, you know, that doesn't make me very difficult.
00:44:48 [W] Just make sure that you are making a secondary copy of it somewhere and backing that up that's going to be absolutely critical.
00:44:57 [W] You know, the only area where you might want to start getting away from ldap is when you start getting into scale-out infrastructure, especially when you're running on top of Cloud native infrastructure you
00:45:12 [W] Use something that is a new SQL type database scales out with your infrastructure can handle thousands of authentications for second, you know something that ldap is
00:45:27 [W] Not currently capable of and Cloud native infrastructure today.
00:45:31 [W] It's just nobody's ever really designed it to do that where you know, it's been picked up by no SQL and some others that are out there like couch TV and and a few others.
00:45:46 [W] What about Phipps compliance is another question? So Phipps compliance typically follows into the standard of some of these paid supported services from
00:46:01 [W] Some of these fun of providers now key cloak and glue open Unison, you'll have to go and look at their pages to see whether or not the fix
00:46:16 [W] Enters their I know that there's a couple of them actually have that available.
00:46:19 [W] So for you know, a federal type implementation these types of things are going to be part of the requirement.
00:46:27 [W] Certainly. Do you research on that if that's a requirement for your infrastructure?
00:46:34 [W] All right.
00:46:35 [W] I think we are pretty close to the end.
00:46:47 [W] Thanks everybody for for joining the session and listening in and really appreciate the feedback. So far in the question so far. If you've got more questions see me over there on the
00:47:02 [W] Who could con 101 channel in slack and we can talk a little bit further.
00:47:08 [W] So thanks everyone.
00:47:09 [W] Have a great day.
