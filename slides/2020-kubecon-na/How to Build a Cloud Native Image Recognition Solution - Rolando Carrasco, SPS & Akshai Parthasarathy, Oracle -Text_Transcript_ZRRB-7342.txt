00:00:00 [W] Thank you.
00:00:00 [W] Thank you for joining us.
00:00:01 [W] I'm Bruno Carrasco am here from with action from Morocco and we are going to talk about how to build the cloud native image recognition solution using Oracle Cloud infrastructure and Services.
00:00:14 [W] My first time presenting and keep going.
00:00:16 [W] What about you actually need to first time at Cube con. Very excited to be talking to you all.
00:00:23 [W] Okay, so let's get started with our own introductions.
00:00:26 [W] I'm going to do it first and then actually is doing himself.
00:00:29 [W] So I am from Mexico say already mentioned.
00:00:32 [W] I started my own company like when like 10 years ago, so it is an msps. I used to work for Oracle about 20 2002 or something.
00:00:41 [W] and then 2010.
00:00:44 [W] I just quit and started my company.
00:00:45 [W] I mean working with Oracle for several years Oracle technology. I mean and that is why I've been joining.
00:00:53 [W] Love advocacy programs Oracle ground breaker program in regulates director and my background is with distributed system.
00:01:02 [W] That's what I've been doing for a while since the old days of Enterprise architecture integration and web services as away and now we're this microservices cognitive architectures and principles.
00:01:16 [W] My contacts. Are there with Twitter. My Twitter handle is in the slide. Also my LinkedIn
00:01:22 [W] So you can contact me with those through those channels. So I think I show you can move forward.
00:01:28 [W] There's no article technology.
00:01:13 [W] I mean and that is why I've been joining couple of advocacy programs or a call Ground breaker program and regulates director and my background is with distributed system.
00:01:26 [W] That's what I've been doing for a while since the old days of Enterprise architecture integration and web services as away and now we're this microservices cognitive architectures and principles my contacts.
00:01:41 [W] Are there with Twitter my Twitter handle is in the slide.
00:01:44 [W] Also my LinkedIn so you can contact me with those through those channels. So I think actually you can move forward.
00:01:53 [W] Thank you. It's my pleasure to be talking to you all but Yolanda today, I am the principal director for Oracle cloud knative devops and observability.
00:02:04 [W] I have about 12 years of experience first with on-prem Technologies and later with Cloud infrastructure across various organizations Dell Amazon web services.
00:02:18 [W] NetApp and startups after that so very excited to be talking to you all if you want to reach out to me my social handles are provided here.
00:02:29 [W] So let's talk a little bit about the story itself, right?
00:02:33 [W] So this is a presentation that has a lot of practical implications the employee seeing that we are include corn. This story is about
00:03:19 [W] of years of experience first with on-prem Technologies and later with Cloud infrastructure across various organizations, Dell Amazon web services NetApp and startups after that so
00:03:51 [W] Mabel principles for this particular very practical problem and we want to share that experience with you how we created these apis on top of Cloud native technology now, the use case itself is
00:04:07 [W] The use of scanned documents IDs contracts and so on. So traditionally a lot of organizations think about loan processing think about Bank Banks and those kinds of Industries anything
00:04:22 [W] Processing of documents is usually employed usually employs, you know people to manually look through those documents populate. Those fields may be inside name your bank account number, you know other identification.
00:04:35 [W] Annually, and as people do it manually it can be slow and not to mention it can also be error-prone and it could honestly be a waste of Human Resources people are made to do much more complicated tasks.
00:04:47 [W] So that's the problem.
00:04:49 [W] We want to solve using Cloud native and AI technology.
00:04:53 [W] So the context for this is that you know, you could have multiple channels in which these documents are provided right?
00:05:00 [W] Maybe they're provided directly. Maybe they're provided to a bank teller in person by the customer.
00:05:06 [W] Maybe they're provided by web or mobile.
00:05:08 [W] Somebody just you know uses the website or their mobile app to send the documents over could be sent by email as well. And there are many other ways. Right and all of these documents usually have to sometimes
00:05:23 [W] Validated against some kind of enterprise system the financial institution like a loan Processing Company might want to ballot the kit validate the account number of the person the name the address and so on.
00:05:36 [W] They also might need to be validated against some kind of government registry. Maybe like if you provide an ID you want to make sure that that ID is genuine.
00:05:46 [W] It's not a false ID at the end of the day, you know SPS undertook a project with a car.
00:05:53 [W] Customer using Oracle Technologies to solve this particular problem.
00:05:58 [W] Our mobile somebody just you know uses the website other mobile app to send the documents over could be sent by email as well. And there are many other ways. Right and all of these documents usually have to sometimes
00:08:07 [W] Loan approval is actually done only after a number of checks like credit check ID check for fake IDs and so on and there are 15 types of documents, you know that need to be reviewed across addresses loan
00:08:23 [W] 15 types of documents, you know that need to be reviewed across addresses loan payments credit scores and many other things right and you want to do it in a cloud knative fashion.
00:08:34 [W] Now Rolando is going to tell us a bit more we work with this customer who has specific challenges and they were looking to streamline that the the time that
00:08:50 [W] Is going to tell us a bit more we work with this customer who has specific challenges and they were looking to streamline that the the time that they take to approve or to
00:09:25 [W] Approve or to reject alone credit.
00:09:28 [W] All right, or a loan or a credit for our mobile. So they were reviewing already these images and these documents but sometimes they they had already asked and but the
00:09:43 [W] Committed was not good. For example, sometimes they documents were scan in Tiff format.
00:09:48 [W] So it was very low resolution. Also, another thing that they had another problem that they had is that sometimes the image was not in the correct position.
00:09:59 [W] Okay, so they needed to rotate it in order to get the information and sometimes while they were doing the rotation some of the elements were were lost. So this process it is very relevant for
00:10:12 [W] them because they use they actually use the documents in order to approve or till or to reject the loan evaluation.
00:10:19 [W] All right, so they use those documents to get it very specific and valuable information for them in order to say, okay. This is a good person in terms of their score and whatever he's showing to us and we are going to approve or reject
00:10:35 [W] So this was kind of the scenario tons of information documents and so on and with that trying to approve or reject. This was our main goal.
00:10:44 [W] It's been always to offer something to our customers into this specific specific customer as well.
00:10:50 [W] Obviously, which is to expose the single API that can receive the document already asked and not only to retrieve the information or to get information from it but to componentconfig
00:11:02 [W] Classify it to manage the information and actually insert if you will the information into the backend transform the format that we needed to do it to rate it for example, if it was
00:11:18 [W] Or some of the elements that we retrieved from the document to be classified intact properly and with that return a level of confidence. So so the so the customer can can realize if the information that is
00:11:23 [W] From the document is with a high level of confidence or with a low level of confidence.
00:11:27 [W] So every time that we increase that level of confidence, then the customer is feeling much more comfortable in order to move forward with their processes.
00:11:35 [W] All right. So this is our main goal. So we are going to be talking about that. We created an API for them and actually an API that we offer to many other customers. So so you can get the idea about many customers using the same API and then all
00:11:50 [W] People started coming together in order to to make a good offering so but the first step is to get the image recognition solution, which is BR the API that I just mentioned in the previous life and which is supported by many Oracle
00:12:02 [W] This plus a couple of Google services.
00:12:01 [W] All right that we are about to talk about and then for this specific customer, we also incorporate an RPA, but which is actually reviewing the information that we get from the first step and then making the decisions either to approve
00:12:16 [W] Reviewing the information that we get from the first step and then making the decisions either to approve or to reject the loan.
00:12:23 [W] Alright, so those two things for this specific customer where created to solve the problem, but for us SPS SPS, we created the API and a couple of things inside that API
00:12:38 [W] In order to offer it to many other customers with Cloud native Solutions.
00:12:43 [W] All right, so that's that was a consequence of dealing with this project and creating this API.
00:12:48 [W] Okay.
00:12:49 [W] Okay, right.
00:12:50 [W] So, you know, we have a number of services from Oracle for cloud knative and devops, you know, but as I talk through these Services the ones that are marked with the checkmark are the ones we use
00:13:05 [W] Or projects that are relevant to this particular use case, but before we go into that one thing I wanted to point out is that Oracle cloud is committed to its openness of its Cloud platform, right?
00:13:19 [W] So resource manager for example is an infrastructure as a service offering that is compatible with open source.
00:13:27 [W] Terraform API Gateway builds off of Open Standards, like open API 3.0 and AP UPI blueprint.
00:13:34 [W] And so on functions is based off of an open source project called f and project that is led by Oracle container engine is a hundred percent open source based off of kubernative.
00:13:47 [W] He's up stream kubernative.
00:13:49 [W] The streaming service is compatible with open source Apache Kafka. We also leverage the cloudevents standard for our event serve as you know, you can specify targets using fluently agents for the logging service.
00:14:05 [W] Ravana for monitoring as well.
00:14:07 [W] So the first one you want to take a look at is the API management of API Gateway.
00:14:11 [W] So when it comes to API management, you know API management could be about design of apis that deployment of apis and then promoting and consuming the apis, right the one that's particularly important in this case is
00:14:26 [W] APS and by deployment of apis, you know what I mean is you should be able to receive API calls, you know as is the case with the application to receive API calls at scale and also receive them and send them to a
00:14:37 [W] That could be load balancers compute kubernative serverless functions.
00:14:28 [W] So serverless functions is what we use in this particular case and you also want to provide the necessary security and rate limiting for these apis API calls to so I roll and I will tell us a bit more about the
00:14:43 [W] Want to provide the necessary security and rate limiting for these apis API calls to so I roll and I will tell us a bit more about the use of API Gateway.
00:14:51 [W] Yeah sure. So there are two main things or to relevant things that we can mention about the usage of Oracle Cloud infrastructure API Gateway for this regard for this specific project, which is the first one is the
00:15:06 [W] Gateway for this regard for this specific project, which is the first one is the customer was looking to have a solution where they need didn't need to use elements in the on premise environment even
00:15:21 [W] Cloud environment that they already had they wanted to have something like can be used as a service. So so we needed to have a place to deploy these services and we realize that Oracle had these API gate with a we can be using in order to
00:15:35 [W] PA is that we delivered to our customers. So that was one thing and the second thing was that we also didn't want it to to manage any servers or any anything related with infrastructure,
00:15:48 [W] To manage any servers or any anything related with infrastructure.
00:15:51 [W] We just wanted to use the service and expose apis and it happens that this Gateway is just like that it is it is a serverless offering from Oracle that we just provision it and then just use it.
00:16:04 [W] So it was it was very straightforward to do that and for us it was fulfilling those two things that the one the customer didn't want to provision anything other end and second thing that
00:16:15 [W] AWS SPS with dealing want to also lose time in order to provision anything related with this.
00:16:23 [W] Oh, so those were the two main reasons that we that we use for them and that there is an extra that we are about to mention but it is the relationship that it has with the Oracle functions, which is what actually is going to mention now.
00:16:36 [W] Yeah, Oracle functions is a serverless platform.
00:16:39 [W] So functions can indicate with Oracle Cloud infrastructure Services, of course the bottom
00:16:45 [W] Oracle Cloud infrastructure can also integrate with platform services and the SAS applications from Oracle write functions is based off of an open source project called a fun project that Oracle leads and you
00:17:01 [W] Is of Open Source it allows applications to be easily ported over from other cloud and on-premises environments.
00:17:10 [W] Rolando, could you tell us a bit more about the use case?
00:17:13 [W] Yes sure. So I just mentioned in the previous Slide the reason or the reasoning about using the API Gateway correct, but then we needed to implement those API. So so we also wanted something to be
00:17:28 [W] Want to use to deploy to manage and we have flexibility in terms of the programming language that we were using and also because of the model that we were looking for with this specific customer, which was to try to charge
00:17:33 [W] each of our system of our API, then the usage of functions was very very technical appealing product for us to use and the second thing is that the serverless model and the commercial model that function has
00:17:43 [W] Use and the second thing.
00:17:42 [W] is that the serverless model and the commercial model that function has is also very good for us because we are just paying for the usage for this.
00:17:49 [W] So we wanted something very flexible for the programming language again that I just mentioned.
00:17:55 [W] we were looking to use Java functions and also node.js functions and we just realize how integrated it is with your the API gave great. So of course
00:18:10 [W] we used the Oracle container engine for kubernative, which is also called oke containers, as you know, easily packaged and move apps and they package just the
00:18:25 [W] These without the operating system so they have advantages of being able to be spun up and spun down quickly container engine for kubernative is provides orchestration at scale.
00:18:37 [W] It's available globally in a number of regions of Oracle Cloud.
00:18:40 [W] It's based off of unmodified kubernative and it's managed service. Of course, it's integrated with oracle's registry.
00:18:48 [W] It's tools for ci/cd like the developer cloud service and other services to Rolando.
00:18:55 [W] Could tell us a bit more about how he's using it for this you sir.
00:18:59 [W] So we just mentioned oci API Gateway. That was the first step for us. Then we use functions as well. And for our first phase of delivering this API, it was good enough to have that because we were able
00:19:14 [W] The requirements we were processing their documents and recognizing the information within those documents, but we already working in a phase 2 for this project in for our offering for many other customers and
00:19:26 [W] We have these Alternatives and there is where okay, he came into the picture one is that sometimes customers are looking to deploy the solution in their own cloudevents and then normally are using a kubernative
00:19:32 [W] for deploying applications that we are able to deploy our Solution on top of kubernative sin, of course on top of okay, so that is one thing we just realized that customers are looking to deploy it at the end why because of the documents
00:19:44 [W] Sometimes are very for security reasons as what I'm trying to say and they want to have everything manage other and right so that's that's one thing and it is kind of normal to have kubernative kubernative sus as the platform where we
00:19:57 [W] It's that's one thing and it is kind of normal to have kubernative kubernative says as the platform where we deploy this. Okay, and the second thing is that we are improving our solution and not just offering a single API,
00:20:09 [W] a single API but we are actually offering a set of web applications where the customer can keep track about the verification of the file or the document or we can provide to them
00:20:24 [W] Each of the platform and many other things that can be used through our web UI and we are actually deploying that webassembly Kitchens on top of kubernative.
00:20:33 [W] So for our from our end, it is pretty easy to have what we just mentioned in terms of functions and oci API Gateway plus okay, because we can mix those things together and deliver a very good solution
00:20:49 [W] Summer so so those are the two things that we are looking for our phase number two actually.
00:20:52 [W] Read object storage is an internet scale storage platform for any type of data. So you can securely store and access any type of data format the reference architecture
00:21:08 [W] Just shows an example of how you can use object storageos upload an image and you use the Oracle functions to get the metadata and store it back into object storage along with the image.
00:21:11 [W] Rolando would tell us a bit more about this more complicated useless.
00:21:17 [W] Yes.
00:21:18 [W] These subjects are storage was very straightforward for us to incorporate it because we are archiving and we are first we are saving documents and
00:21:31 [W] Managing them through the object storage.
00:21:33 [W] So every time that we receive a document we are restoring it in the object storage.
00:21:37 [W] Why because for later purposes, for example, the tracking of the document or if we need to retrieve the document to for any other type of analysis than we have it there and secondly because we can archive it and this is
00:21:52 [W] Just generate the rules for the archiving and information is being archived automatically. So those two reasons were that were our reasoning in order to use it one just to store every single document that we are using
00:22:04 [W] Because of the archiving capabilities and it happens that between functions and object storage is pretty simple to to mix them. So technically also it was very straightforward to do it.
00:22:09 [W] Okay, so now before we go to the demo, we just wanted to highlight how we are connecting the dots and connecting the dots means that we have the use case.
00:22:20 [W] We already explained to you the use case then we explain a set of Oracle services and then we are going to connect what we had as a use case and as a need and how with Oracle technology we are able to fulfill
00:22:35 [W] Have the use case.
00:22:34 [W] We already explained to you the use case then we explain a set of Oracle services.
00:22:40 [W] And then we are going to connect what we had as a use case and as a need and how with Oracle technology we are able to fulfill that need.
00:22:49 [W] Okay, so we had now all the information in order to deploy our application and fulfill the needs that that we just mentioned. So in the next slide we are going to check it.
00:23:03 [W] exactly how how we connect those two two sides of the story alright needs and the direct containerd not because this is the process the solution of our process that we after we realize
00:23:18 [W] This is the process the solution of our process that we after we realize how to use the different Oracle elements.
00:23:28 [W] This was the set of seven steps that we were able to deploy and and to make them together in order to deliver the solution.
00:23:36 [W] So there is one first step to transform the documents then how to upload them. Then how we classify that document if it is an idea or if it is a
00:23:47 [W] balance or whatever and then how we curated document the document remember that sometimes images are rotated or has some elements that are for example low resolution.
00:23:58 [W] Then we go to the Google apis and retrieval of information and then we tag every single element so we can identify it properly.
00:24:06 [W] We also have this machine learnings in order to identify the documents and obviously the recognition about the elements from within the document. So so these are the seven steps that we were following.
00:24:18 [W] In those seven steps are going into these elements from work all the components from Oracle. So we're going to just highlight two or three of them.
00:24:28 [W] So for example for the documents or blow we are using again oci API Gateway, which is the first Contact from our customers with us in order to receive the document then the object storage Where We
00:24:43 [W] Nation also the classification curation and tagging.
00:24:48 [W] We are using the Oracle functions.
00:24:49 [W] We have a specific article functions that are doing them and then we have other elements that we already mentioned I gu for the OCR and also for the machine learning.
00:24:59 [W] Okay.
00:24:59 [W] Okay. So now we are just going through very fast to review this flow which is a sequential diagram or sequence iron story where we can see how this logdna.
00:25:13 [W] Elements are been playing together.
00:25:14 [W] So whatever we choose mentioned in previous slides about the oci API Gateway dfm project Oracle functions Google and the object storage is it is right here so you can see these steps that we are taking and how the information is
00:25:30 [W] And it is hitting every single product that we just mentioned and how we are using it. And again every single layer that we are using is is it's a serverless offering either from from Morocco.
00:25:41 [W] So so it was pretty pretty easy to deploy.
00:25:44 [W] All right.
00:25:44 [W] So this is the architecture that we use and I mean, this is very simple very simple diagram, but we are going to use it. This is the things that we
00:25:56 [W] use functions getting related with the object storage as we mention the oci API grid presenting those functions into the external world for our third parties and being the first leg with that we received the document and
00:26:11 [W] This is the things that we use functions getting related with the object storage as we mention the oci API grid presenting those functions into the external world for our third parties and being the first
00:26:33 [W] Supported by the Google apis in order to read retrieve the information from the document and also for the machine learning itself.
00:26:41 [W] So these are our environment.
00:26:43 [W] This is our ecosystem if you will, okay, and then we are going to do the demonstration in order to show you whatever we just mentioning in previous slides.
00:26:54 [W] All right.
00:26:55 [W] Okay.
00:26:55 [W] So let's go for the day. Okay. So this is the web application that we built here in SPSS. This is a work from linear servicemeshcon.
00:27:03 [W] Q and R Kudo on salads from my team or credits to them because they were the ones who created this I am showcasing it now, but they are the ones who created this from from scratch.
00:27:14 [W] So this is the web application. So this is basically what an end-user could be using but behind the scenes it is happening what I just explained.
00:27:24 [W] So the the API Gateway functions the Google apis object stores and an old and know what I just mentioned in previous slide.
00:27:33 [W] Right, so we are going to do two things.
00:27:35 [W] We're going to scan or not.
00:27:38 [W] Just can we are going to upload two documents one it is.
00:27:41 [W] a high level or high level of confidence level sorry document which is in in a very good shape. If you will that we are going to evaluate the score for that
00:27:56 [W] Worries and no and know what I just mentioned in previous Night's Alright, so we are going to do two things.
00:28:02 [W] We're going to scan or not to scan. We are going to upload two documents one. It is a high level or high level of confidence level sorry document which is in the in a very good shape if you
00:28:37 [W] Telephone line balance for Arturo actually, and secondly, we are going to upload balance both for the internet subscription for our company SPS and you're going to get the difference from those to the first one
00:28:52 [W] Which is a Dell makes balance.
00:28:54 [W] This is a document that we have the scanned for that and the level of confidence for this is very high that just keep in mind something that if you are just thinking well, this is basically they are uploading the
00:29:09 [W] Into the Google API and just retrieving whatever Google is it is getting back to them.
00:29:11 [W] That's not the case because in the normal process what we have is these rastering process which goes from left to the right and from up and down and it is basically taking the elements of the document as I mentioned from left to
00:29:26 [W] From left to the right and from up and down and it is basically taking the elements of the document as I mentioned from left to right. So if you can imagine for example in line, which is CLL Porfirio Diaz
00:29:38 [W] If you can imagine for example in line, which is CLL Porfirio Diaz 8 and then swiss-style the quaint oppressor.
00:29:46 [W] It has nothing to do the one in the right the left.
00:29:50 [W] Sorry is the address. Okay, and the one of the right it is just a paragraph. It is informative things or it is just informational section of the document.
00:30:00 [W] All right. So if we go just left to right and get information from it is not going to be very valuable it is
00:30:07 [W] Google itself but it is not relevant for them for the business process itself.
00:30:12 [W] So if we go down and see the result for the API, this is the actual result of the API. We have different sections in the result.
00:30:20 [W] The first section is this which is what we call the quality gate. So as you remember in the sequence diagram that I showed in previous slides we had the first step or one of the first steps was to get through the quality gate and the
00:30:36 [W] The general score for the document and the general score of the document.
00:30:40 [W] We are trying or we are targeting to have it above the 70% So it is point 7 if we have a general score above above .7, then it is a document that we trust that the information that is it that this
00:30:55 [W] Is this accurate?
00:30:50 [W] Okay, if we get an A score below that point seven then you can definitely use the information but the level of confidence is not going to be high and the second thing that this thing is recognizing is the language of the document
00:31:05 [W] This is getting this is a Spanish.
00:31:03 [W] Oh it is it is getting the information in the right language this case again in Spanish. And then we have whatever the OCR returned to us.
00:31:14 [W] Okay, and this is basically all the information that was able to retrieve it has now a little order itself. Now, we have a structured in such a way that it is not the left to the right and up and down that I
00:31:29 [W] resting process we have very clear Vision about addresses names numbers and so on what if you take a look into the lower part of the application, which is the NLP detected labels
00:31:40 [W] Just returning the information from the document, but we are able to classify it so we can see that this has an X and an expiration date which is we can serve it which is the name in Spanish we have number which is name in English, and it's
00:31:49 [W] Israel mirror to do we have the address for for Arturo and the election it is the name or that's the word that we use in Spanish Direction address in English and now we can get or return the information.
00:31:59 [W] That it is.
00:31:57 [W] It is understandable what it is really?
00:32:00 [W] We are not just returning the information and that's it. And okay use it.
00:32:03 [W] No, we are able to classify it and give you a level of confidence in this case pretty much the name the experiential on dates and the address you have a hundred percent level of confidence that this is the right information so you you can manage this
00:32:19 [W] Your will so this is this is a very high level of confidence actually the top level of confidence.
00:32:22 [W] But in the other hand if we upload the order document which is internet subscription balanced by this company by the name extent and this is for our own company services and process Illusions
00:32:38 [W] This company by the name extent and this is for our own company services and process Illusions or SPS.
00:32:39 [W] This is probably you are thinking well, this is good document. It is clear. The image is not that bad. But there are some elements that are not going to allow us to read to return a high level of confidence.
00:32:52 [W] One of those things is that the size of the font it is it is kind of a small so as you can see there are sections of the document that we see that the syseleven
00:33:02 [W] of the font is not that good.
00:33:04 [W] It is actually pretty small.
00:33:05 [W] So it's going to be difficult to retrieve it. The actually Google itself is or has a minimum regarding the size of the phone. So that's one thing the second thing is that some of the elements that we can
00:33:21 [W] And are elements that can be confused in what way that probably instead of a 0 we are recognizing it as a know for example, so there are elements of the may be complicated to recognize and the third thing is for example in this
00:33:35 [W] That we are putting here in the screen. It is a long strings of information that in this case represents something related with the IRS.
00:33:40 [W] And as you can see those strings are first of all, they are kind of long and in order to identify what they are.
00:33:48 [W] It's going to be difficult because as you can see they have nonsense, they're just pretty much a sweet sequence of characters. So if we go below to the Quality Gator score, then we may see that they these
00:33:59 [W] document in a specific has a very lowest score Point fifty three. So the quality get says no this is this probably needs a manual provision that does not mean that you will not be able to use information.
00:34:12 [W] Actually.
00:34:13 [W] The information is here in the section of the OCR a structured text. We can see the information by itself and in the NLP detected labels. We we see that these level of score is not that high as the previous one.
00:34:25 [W] actually did the whole process.
00:34:29 [W] we are able to process the whole document and retrieve from from the apis the value or the level of confidence and and the labels and also the we are able to group the information, but
00:34:45 [W] so high in terms of the score and just to finalize the expansion of the demo as I was mentioning the rastering process, that's something that we use and we actually program in Oracle functions because
00:34:57 [W] That's something that we use and we actually program in Oracle functions because we know that because of the position of the elements in the document we are able to recognize what it is and to
00:35:01 [W] That because of the position of the elements in the document. We are able to recognize what it is and to identify that that is that the name is written actually in the name section. The address is written in the address section
00:35:16 [W] Then in the address section because of the position in the document. So if we make some some mathematical calculation we are able to return to to identify and group the information that we get from the documents, but this is basically mathematical calculation.
00:35:31 [W] The end the rest during process it is the same time giving us some Matrix dot matrix a we are able to get information doing some mathematical calculations.
00:35:43 [W] All right. So this is what we wanted to show you we show two different documents to different levels of confidence score. We explain how those different elements are in the mix.
00:35:54 [W] And with these probably you are you are having a different idea of what we are what we are doing and what we are achieving.
00:36:01 [W] Okay, so thank you for being with us in the demonstration.
00:36:05 [W] This is the list of things that we learn for deploying this we have benefits for the business and also technical benefits the benefits for the business and we are we are
00:36:20 [W] We are giving you these conclusions because Cloud native is about worrying for the business needs.
00:36:26 [W] Okay, and we are using the technology in order to deliver a solution for that.
00:36:30 [W] So it is very relevant for us to highlight the BT the benefits for the business and what we learn with this and the first thing is that we streamline the credit and loans approval and delivery.
00:36:41 [W] So it was it was very clear how this reduce the amount of time that they were using to review the document. So
00:36:49 [W] it was a maybe a 90% of the time was reused. Also. We are allowing consumers to upload information directly.
00:37:00 [W] They don't need to go to the branches or have an in-person meeting in order to deliver the documents or scan those documents.
00:37:07 [W] They can do it through different channels the institution.
00:37:10 [W] It is actually now presenting apis for third parties. So this is also very useful for them.
00:37:16 [W] So now they are offering these services for third.
00:37:19 [W] So now they can have external organization using their platform in order to review documents and and be part of this chain of activities and also for the in terms of manual intervention.
00:37:34 [W] we reduce that because now we don't have these large or very large teams reviewing those documents and for the technical side of the house.
00:37:42 [W] We streamline the deployment. Obviously.
00:37:46 [W] The the customer infrastructure if they want that we are also having constant changes and we have the ability with cognitive in order to incorporate those changes and also in terms of the scalability ci/cd. We have these this way
00:37:52 [W] To scale and pretty easily with with all these Oracle Cloud infrastructure component. So this is kind of our summary.
00:37:48 [W] Hopefully you found that interesting and we're just finalizing sharing with you our contacts again our social network contact.
00:37:59 [W] And so you can check out the GitHub repositories the category the category the scenarios from the land. Oh and also, you know, we have some product web pages for Oracle Cloud infrastructure pure. So interested in giving a look
00:38:14 [W] Or even trying the cloud. So please feel free to reach us on Twitter on and Linkedin or handles are provided there.
00:38:23 [W] We are now ready to take any questions you may have.
00:39:17 [W] I gotta let it tomorrow.
00:39:27 [W] Are we ready?
00:39:33 [W] Yes, yeah.
00:39:36 [W] Yes.
