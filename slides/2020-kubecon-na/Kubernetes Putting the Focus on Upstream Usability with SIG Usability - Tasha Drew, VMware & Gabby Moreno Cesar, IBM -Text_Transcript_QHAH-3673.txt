00:00:00 [W] Okay, then we'll just go.
00:00:02 [W] Come to Sig use abilities Community update here at Keuka North America 2020. What we've been focused on is really kicking off six usability over the past year and getting some of our first projects off the ground and we're excited to be able to share with you both.
00:00:18 [W] What we're doing here at Sig usability why the kubernative community has decided to kick off sick usability in the first place and then some of the projects that were working on as well as how you can find us in the Upstream community and get engaged just to introduce myself really
00:00:33 [W] Flee and Tasha Drew.
00:00:34 [W] I'm the director of product incubation at VMware and I am the co-chair of Sig usability and I'm also the co-chair of the working group for multi-tenancy and kubernative.
00:00:47 [W] My name is Gabby Gabby mirantis Caesar and IBM started contributing to sink usability about a year ago and it got started and I'm a ux designer on the kubernative design team.
00:01:03 [W] I'm Karl Pearson.
00:01:05 [W] I am a ux researcher formally at red hat and I've been involved with the Sig for about half a year now.
00:01:19 [W] Cool, so when we kicked off Sig usability it was for a very sort of silly reason initially which was that at VMware.
00:01:30 [W] We've been working on vsphere and kubernative and we had a bunch of icons that we've open sourced as part of a Clarity dot design project.
00:01:39 [W] And so we were wondering what the Upstream iconography for kubernative was and if we could work with them to have Upstream icons tufin.
00:01:47 [W] Figure out like if I'm looking at something as a container, is it a cluster?
00:01:51 [W] Is it a node?
00:01:52 [W] And then as we sort of as I sort of dug through the various mailing lists kind of ask my question it started this torrent on the mailing list about how we really as a community as an upstream kubernative Community needed to make
00:02:07 [W] usability more of a top-level focus and some so from from that we realized that we needed to form a special interest group which in the kubernative use Upstream Community is how we organize
00:02:21 [W] Contributions basically, so here we see back in 2019 new stack had a sort of Evergreen article about how ux is kubernative biggest short-term challenge.
00:02:32 [W] We really see from people who are adopting kubernative use that getting started and understanding how to use the project and understanding how to manage life cycle and extensions can all be pretty confusing.
00:02:48 [W] Using additionally, here's a study from new stack also in 2019 saying top areas the kubernative project needs to address in 2020 and we see at the top really two things that can be pretty tightly coupled to coredns
00:03:00 [W] The issues which is core kubernetes needs to start thinking about the administrator operational experience of operating kubernative and also the developer experience of deploying applications and automating their life cycle on kubernative.
00:03:13 [W] So from this data and from our own experiences as creators of kubernative and as users and implementers of kubernative, we realized that we really needed to make usability a top level concern and the Upstream Community to make sure that
00:03:29 [W] Were enabling people to really use kubernative in the way that it could be if it was a little more user-friendly.
00:03:40 [W] So where to find us? So in the Upstream Community the kubernetes communities organized into six or special interest groups and So currently we have three teachers of Sig usability myself Gabby and himanshu if you want
00:03:55 [W] Engage with us, but I would really suggest the best first step to be is to go to Google Groups.
00:04:00 [W] So just type groups that google.com in your browser and look up Sig - usability kubernative use and you'll find our Google group.
00:04:08 [W] This is really a mailing list. And the mailing list is how we organize everything such as sending out calendar invitations having group conversations around various projects were working on sharing links sharing documents.
00:04:20 [W] So if you're on the Google group, you'll get the invitations to our regular.
00:04:24 [W] Things you can attend those meetings.
00:04:26 [W] They're open to the public.
00:04:27 [W] You'll be able to see our meeting minutes.
00:04:30 [W] You'll be able to see our notes you'll be able to link two interesting things that were working on. So I really don't want to undersell the Google group because that should really be your first step if you're like, oh this is cool group of people working on things.
00:04:42 [W] I'm interested in I'd like to kind of understand maybe to start participating Google group is really the best first step. The other thing. I'd like to call out and this applies to every Google group is that when you join the Google group, you will not immediately.
00:04:54 [W] The calendar invitation there's some lag in the system and so just just be patient. It may take up to five days because you know, maybe there's a carrier pigeon involved in the back end.
00:05:06 [W] I have no idea but you will eventually get this calendar invitation that will allow you to join our regular meetings here at Sig usability some other places. You can find us. We do have a page on the kubernetes - Sig so we have a repo
00:05:21 [W] There were starting to use the project tracker and highlight some of the work that we're working on.
00:05:26 [W] And so that's a good spot to kind of check out then.
00:05:31 [W] We also post all of our videos to YouTube. You'll find these meeting notes the link that I posted here.
00:05:37 [W] You'll also have edit access to when you join our Google group. And finally there is a kubernative slack where all of the Upstream maintainers have various channels for their Sig and different organizing functions so you can join
00:05:50 [W] The kubernetes slack Channel and then we have a Sig usability Channel there where you can also talk to us so tldr join the Google group The Links at the bottom of this page.
00:06:01 [W] We'd love to see what our meetings and we definitely are always interested in seeing new ways that people seek to address and improve upstreams projects usability and also involve you in some of our projects.
00:06:14 [W] I'm now going to hand over to Gabby to lead us through something that we've been working on recently.
00:06:21 [W] Thanks Tasha. So I'm going to be giving an overview of one of the projects that we have going on.
00:06:28 [W] We're calling it our jobs to be done study a little bit of background first just about you know, my open source contributions.
00:06:37 [W] I hadn't contributed to open source before and so about a year or so and you know, this opportunity came up. So usability started and I just saw it as a really cool opportunity to be able to
00:06:50 [W] on do this type of user research as part of Open Source and with Tash has helped and Carl we've been able to put together this really great team around this project the main questions that were that
00:07:05 [W] Has to be done is kind of trying to answer is one like who's using kubernative most importantly they for those people what are they trying to achieve?
00:07:16 [W] What's kubernative?
00:07:18 [W] He's you know, kubernative is the technology but like what are they trying to do? And you know, what other options did they consider before deciding on kubernative?
00:07:28 [W] How did once they do adopt communities how do they go about kind of like working towards that objective or that goal and ultimately at the end of those were trying to figure out what are the top opportunities for for the open source
00:07:43 [W] Unity to be able to improve kubernative and we have a pretty good set of people here myself Tasha Carl Josie from pivotal and then boas as well.
00:07:56 [W] For those of you that haven't heard of jobs to be done.
00:07:58 [W] This is kind of like the my favorite way of explaining it is that people don't want a quarter-inch drill drill being the technology.
00:08:07 [W] They want a quarter inch hole.
00:08:10 [W] So, you know example of this could be like it if someone's trying to drill a hole and they had an adjustable lightsaber to do that, you know, they would buy the lightsaber instead of the drill. So if you
00:08:24 [W] Focus just completely on building this like perfect quarter-inch drill, you kind of missed the point or your the opportunity to be able to help somebody just drill that perfect quarter inch hole.
00:08:37 [W] So this is a pretty industry standard approach and methodology.
00:08:43 [W] We just wanted to call out the two sources that we've been referencing. Mainly this book jobs to be done by Rosenfeld media.
00:08:54 [W] And then also jobs to be done by Tony Olek who who started the firm strategy and so they're really well-known for doing this approach as well.
00:09:07 [W] It just to cover some of the jobs to be done kind of like standard terminology.
00:09:12 [W] On the job being like you want to drill the quarter inch hole or you want to prepare a meal for example, if we took the meal example and like looked at the steps involved into making a meal you don't just make a meal
00:09:27 [W] You need to go to the grocery store. You need to know or maybe like do like an online service or something like that to figure out like first.
00:09:35 [W] What are you going to make then?
00:09:37 [W] What do you need in order to make it double check that you have the right amount of everything and then you can make the meal and if you like the meal, you know, you may conclude that it was a good meal and that you'll make it again or
00:09:52 [W] Are you may decide that this was not the best and they're like next time that's kind of like the highest level concept behind jobs to be done. Is that you do your analysis around this job?
00:10:06 [W] The other concept that's important to call out is this idea of a desired outcome which again goes back to the drill the quarter inch hole not the drill.
00:10:16 [W] And so if we take a music example an example here is let's minimize the time it takes to get songs in the desired order for listening and if you kind of like look at this statement, it feels like very specific
00:10:32 [W] And the reason is that it is, you know, we have the reason that it's structured this way.
00:10:37 [W] And again, this is from jobs to be done is because you know after you do qualitative interviews to to figure out like what's the job?
00:10:46 [W] what are the steps this kind of like importance a survey that you sent out with all these desired outcomes and you Jen end up generating maybe like a hundred 250 of these.
00:10:59 [W] And what happens is that when you send this survey out, you ask people. You know, how important is this to you? Also how satisfied are you with your ability to do it right now?
00:11:12 [W] And so, you know, you get people's input on these very structured statements and what ends up coming out of this is really amazing opportunity landscape.
00:11:25 [W] So if you like here
00:11:28 [W] At the little late at the quadrants you have everything from over-served over-served being that people.
00:11:34 [W] we're very satisfied and it's not very important.
00:11:38 [W] So probably don't want to focus on that. But then on the opposite Spectrum you have outcomes that are very important to people and they're not very satisfied with how they're done today.
00:11:52 [W] And so what we call those is underserved, you know, it's very important to people too.
00:11:58 [W] To do these are not satisfied and so you as a project or you as a community, how can you better serve these and then you have everything in the middle which is like mid importance and mid satisfaction.
00:12:10 [W] So what we've done so far as far as this process is we're still pretty early on but what we have done is we have designed is screening survey, which we sent out
00:12:25 [W] To collect basically background information on people people that use kubernative and we also included or freeform response and put in a net promoter score as well.
00:12:38 [W] And we sent this out through the cncf Twitter as a way to both qualify these people and just kind of see what their use of containers and kubernative ziz, but also, you know for the
00:12:53 [W] Eight weeks that we ran this survey of the 1,800 people that responded 41 of those agreed to be contacted.
00:13:00 [W] So what we're going to be doing next is setting up qualitative interviews with these people, but we also wanted to share from the survey that we that we sent out the data that came back because we also think that this is super interesting that talks about a little bit about how
00:13:15 [W] People use kubernative and containers and so with that I'm going to pass it off the Carl and Carl is going to take us through the analysis that he did on the survey.
00:13:29 [W] Thanks, Gabby.
00:13:31 [W] So yeah, we collected all of this data to get a background for some of these folks that we hope to interview down the road and we got people from all over the world. Mainly Europe and North America, but a few people from
00:13:46 [W] In Central America as well for the organization type.
00:13:50 [W] We have a lot of people that didn't fit into the buckets of consultant or managed service provider so we could be any other kind of organization had the fewest consultants and still a good number of managed service providers as well.
00:14:11 [W] And we also looked at people's job function in their role. So the job function is on the left and the role is on the right.
00:14:17 [W] So we primarily have software Architects devops management and back-end developers that is kind of the three that are leading the pack there, but we did get a really really wide spread. So we have some things that are probably a lot less
00:14:32 [W] Anything kubernative such as sales or marketing, so there are pretty pretty wide set of people that responded to this. Although most of the people are some of the more typical titles that come to mind.
00:14:45 [W] We mostly had individual contributors or Consultants, but we still got a good number of a managers or or directors as well.
00:14:55 [W] So we're hoping that we can talk to people that are both in the ICU roles and then more of the the management roles.
00:15:02 [W] As well when we do these interviews.
00:15:10 [W] For the environments that these folks had by Far and Away people were running quite a few machines.
00:15:16 [W] So our biggest bucket was 5,000 or more machines and that's how most people responded. So a lot of people were in that highest bucket the ones that were lower or kind of surprisingly evenly spread. So if we end up running a survey like
00:15:31 [W] This again.
00:15:32 [W] I imagine we might you know, maybe break it up into five to ten thousand and then more than 10,000. So people are running a lot of machines and their kubernative environments for the data center types. Most people are running in public Cloud, but
00:15:47 [W] People are also running private cloud or on-premise has as well for our respondents a lot fewer running hybrid cloud and one person wrote in a response bare metal cube, Min, which I would imagine would probably end up being
00:16:02 [W] Bucketed with private Cloud, but yeah, mostly public or private hybrid is definitely there but not as strong as the other two.
00:16:13 [W] We also looked at activities.
00:16:16 [W] So what people are actually doing with kubernetes when they're working in it.
00:16:20 [W] So these sort of teal blue color is when people are very involved with the item red is when there's someone involved in Orange is when they're not at all involved.
00:16:29 [W] So the things that people were most likely to be involved with we're working with infrastructure resources researching and evaluating purchasing new tech monitoring and troubleshooting applications managing deployment pipelines managing.
00:16:44 [W] Cloud platform developing software and architecting software people are less likely to be involved in working with AI or machine learning systems and people were kind of just somewhat involved with managing data processes, which I imagine is
00:16:59 [W] Somewhat aligned with the folks that actually are working more with the AI and all systems.
00:17:08 [W] And for kubernative use it would make sense given who we we sampled for this but people are currently using kubernative across proof of concept to production by far and away.
00:17:23 [W] So it's kind of interesting that folks don't really give up on the proof of concept.
00:17:28 [W] They're still trying out new things within kubernative, even when they're running it in production. A lot of people have moved past proof of concept for future plans.
00:17:38 [W] Which means it might be you know, somewhat more cemented in the way that people are using kubernative Zin. They're in their work environments.
00:17:50 [W] And so we also looked at what resources people use to learn about kubernative. Use documentation is very very strongly in the lead here.
00:17:59 [W] But everything else also has a good showing so these other ones are fairly even but Twitter is pretty common.
00:18:07 [W] This might be a little biased because we did send this out via Twitter, but everything else is again pretty even so people are going everywhere from YouTube stackoverflow a lot of people wrote In other.
00:18:19 [W] It says and they were more likely to mention specific resources in those other comments.
00:18:25 [W] So maybe like a specific person on YouTube or a specific book or something like that. But documentation is still definitely the leader where people are going to learn about kubernative.
00:18:38 [W] And finally the net promoter score something we asked about so you've probably seen one of these multiple times. It's worse company will email you or give you a pop up and it will say How likely are you to recommend our product to a colleague or friend and
00:18:53 [W] Your answer on a scale of zero to 10 10 being more likely to recommend that product.
00:18:59 [W] So this is a really really common marketing or customer experience measurement to gauge General sentiment towards a brand or product and is calculated in this way where if people answer a nine or ten, they're called a promoter.
00:19:13 [W] is our green bucket passive is seven or eight that's kind of the middle bucket and then detractor is 0 to 6 and the way that you
00:19:22 [W] relate this score in the industry standard way is you kind of throw out the passives you take the percentage of promoters and then you subtract the percentage of detractors and you end up with this percentage score and so our percentage score that we came up
00:19:37 [W] With for kubernative uses 62.5 in the scale actually goes from negative 100 to positive 100.
00:19:44 [W] So this is fairly high and considering across most Industries.
00:19:49 [W] This is actually a super super high NPS score, which is really interesting.
00:19:53 [W] looked in a little bit to see if we could find data around other open source projects that might have been measured in this way, but it doesn't seem to be a very common metric to be used on open source projects. So we don't know if this is, you know, relatively
00:20:07 [W] early high or low compared to other open source projects, but across the board. This is a very very high score which shows a lot of Engagement from the people that use kubernative Ace.
00:20:20 [W] And that's it for the data. So I'll give it back to Gabby. Thank you.
00:20:26 [W] Cool.
00:20:26 [W] Thanks Carl, and just to wrap up as far as the next steps for us and the jobs to be done study right now.
00:20:34 [W] We're working on setting up user new interviews. Like we mentioned from the people that responded to the survey out of that will come, you know, a lot of analysis kind of going back through responses and extracting out
00:20:50 [W] job map that I showed at the beginning and also understanding what those desired outcomes are ultimately will put all of this in a survey and send it out again and after doing analysis on
00:21:05 [W] The results of that survey will be able to generate this a very nice opportunity landscape that that I talked about in the beginning.
00:21:15 [W] So with that that's pretty much it.
00:21:18 [W] Thank you for coming to our talk and let us know if you have any questions.
00:21:27 [W] Dad thanks everybody and we'd love to have so all of this data is going to be open sourced.
00:21:33 [W] We look forward to sharing it with everyone who's interested.
00:21:36 [W] And then if you want to chat more about with us about what we're doing and how you can get engaged definitely join our slack Channel and check out the Google group, and we'd love to chat more. So and we're happy to answer any questions people have
00:21:51 [W] In the audience now that the chatbots over.
00:21:54 [W] anks.
00:22:02 [W] Whoo.
00:22:05 [W] everyone looks like we don't have any questions.
00:22:08 [W] I hope you found our chat talk to useful.
00:22:12 [W] yeah, hope to engage with you soon in the open source community.
