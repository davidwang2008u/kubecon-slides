Transcription for wordly [W]

00:00:00 [W] Cloud native friends kubernative family.
00:00:02 [W] Welcome to the cloud knative circus with that said, let's Dive Right into an ocean of entertainment.
00:00:09 [W] I will be your ring master or your host Jeff Rasika.
00:00:14 [W] The internet and I'm also a cloud native gesture for this talk.
00:00:18 [W] Not an ambassador.
00:00:19 [W] I work in the kubernetes community in various capacities and I happen to be and I'm well known for being a goose enthusiastic.
00:00:28 [W] I'm sure many of you were curious what the heck this talk was going to be about also at this point.
00:00:34 [W] I think it's expected that any talk.
00:00:36 [W] I do will have some geese in it.
00:00:37 [W] I may as well just lean into it. So first I want to discuss and talk about what Untitled goose k8s.
00:00:43 [W] Game is and how it got into our community.
00:00:46 [W] Then I want to talk about why honks ETL one of the projects that I'm known for became so popular then I want to discuss the idea of a cloud native Computing Fugue vs. Cloud knative Computing camaraderie and fun and when I say
00:01:01 [W] Fugue I mean this Tech has a way of getting our eyes to glaze over at times.
00:00:50 [W] It's not easy at face value. It's an onion there are lots of layers and the more you peel back the more likely you'll cry and lastly I want to end with why we need to have more fun in Cloud native computing.
00:01:06 [W] For those of you that already know what Untitled Goose game is talk to the goose for those that don't let me explain in Untitled Goose game you play as a Goose you are given a somewhat malicious to-do list and the goal is to
00:01:21 [W] on the to-do list this type of game format is somewhat like a Sandbox Style game except the sandbox is small and you are a very naughty Goose so much of what the goose does involves terrorizing this town,
00:01:28 [W] Angle to it the goose constantly Maneuvers and manipulates the environment to circumvent rules boundaries and other limitations trying to keep the goose in check.
00:01:32 [W] It's no surprise that this Goose was adopted into many Tech circles, especially security as an avatar of Chaos.
00:01:41 [W] Now with that out of the way, I want to talk about convergent evolution.
00:01:44 [W] It's the idea that given similar environments things will evolve in similar ways to overcome or optimize their lives GP. I hear you ask.
00:01:54 [W] Why don't you just jump from explaining a video game to starting a biology lesson?
00:01:58 [W] Well, did I say convergent evolution?
00:02:01 [W] I meant convergent me malucia knative.
00:02:11 [W] We're information streams memes and fun ideas often come about at the same time from different people as an aside.
00:02:18 [W] I wanted to joke and say Mimi Aleutian, but I figured they would just not accept the talk and fill the slot with someone else, but I still need to just toss that one in there Hollywood has this problem all the time.
00:02:31 [W] They're called twin movies. No relation to Twin Peaks know this involves similar movies that are released in close proximity to one another that styra.
00:02:40 [W] Bear as Raiden in Mortal Kombat. So let's this let's bring this all together and talk about last year's Cube con and a 2019.
00:02:50 [W] As I've mentioned I do various things around the kubernative community. One of which at the time was helping organize the contributor Summit my best friend Bob Killin who's widely known in the community got to talking with me one morning about doing a goose
00:03:05 [W] That spiraled wildly out of control as it does with he and I and it turned into a contest to make a brown paper bag honk we had our own Untitled Goose game. To-do list with various challenges the simplest of which was
00:03:16 [W] Jeff the bag had a Bluetooth speaker, which would honk based on tweets or slack messages and people had to figure out what triggered the bag to honk and Trigger it in front of us to be eligible for either a patch or one of the prized geese.
00:03:26 [W] We thought this was hilarious and good clean fun and everyone else seemed to enjoy it and throughout Cube con Bob, and I frequently got honked at
00:03:35 [W] Little did we know the patron saint of Honker Nettie's our very own Ian cold water planned on delivering one of the best key notes or Goose notes at doesn't matter.
00:03:46 [W] It was fantastic.
00:03:47 [W] It laid out how we should always consider the perspective of an attacker and how Untitled Goose game is a great analog to thinking about security from the eyes of a malcontent.
00:03:57 [W] It is seriously, excellent. If you haven't seen it, please go watch it.
00:04:03 [W] The progressive honking the constant element of fun jokes and aha moments that Untitled Goose game brought us at keep con ultimately cemented it in our community's culture for the foreseeable future.
00:04:14 [W] We are all geese in the machine. It is in our nature to have fun.
00:04:20 [W] Yes.
00:04:21 [W] Everyone's idea of fun is different. But our natural state is to seek out fun and it is that drive and creativity that no matter the
00:04:31 [W] It's not easy for many.
00:04:31 [W] It's complex.
00:04:33 [W] There are progressively more and more layers. And if you talk to someone outside of the know it can be intimidating.
00:04:38 [W] I want to showcase some of our communities more memorable instances of fun and what better way to start off than breadsticks during his leading of the 116 release
00:04:53 [W] Ambassador Locke he became known as a breadstick Aficionado and general Olive Garden Enthusiast. It was an endless burlock barrage of Olive Garden memes gift cards photos trips to the restaurant all
00:05:00 [W] The kubernative 116 logo for those of you that didn't know yes kubernative 116 was indeed powered by and advocated for unlimited breadsticks for all.
00:05:08 [W] So prominent is this meme that to this day Locke is synonymous with breadsticks to some Brandon you weren't that far off.
00:05:18 [W] Another creative way of having community-based fun.
00:05:21 [W] I've seen recently is Cards Against containers a play on Cards Against Humanity in the game one player draws a card containing a phrase with one or more blank words. The rest of the players must try to make the first player laugh as much as possible
00:05:36 [W] For example, if I had the card blank makes my job exciting and someone played dumpster fire.
00:05:40 [W] I'd laugh heartily and likely pick that card as the winner. It's quite a simple format in Endless amounts of fun.
00:05:48 [W] During the 2018 Seattle Cube con the community decided on Twitter. It's not Cube qanats Cube con with Google's Borg being a kubernative distant uncle and other various Star Trek references in kubernative the
00:06:03 [W] This was an incredibly on-brand joke. And of course, the mean was made manifest with stickers. It is definitely stuck around in the community because a full year after Seattle people are still screaming it out at dinner.
00:06:05 [W] Goose stickers weren't the only thing that happened at last year's contributor Summit for kubernative the lead of that Summit Paris Pittman bestowed upon her Mighty crew of Captain's hats embroidered with the person's GitHub handle on it.
00:06:19 [W] It was a wonderful gesture.
00:06:20 [W] Mine is on my bookshelf behind me and it also helped throughout the summit as people look for anyone wearing these hats for help mission accomplished and it was totally on brand with everything in kubernative being nautical-themed.
00:06:34 [W] And with many of us being engineer's and open source developers, of course, there will be some technical nerdy fun in the form of / commands throughout the kubernative Repose and even on Twitter. You can slash honk / Pony / wolf even /
00:06:49 [W] It's content.
00:06:43 [W] There's nothing quite like seeing some progress on that complicated pull request and deciding to celebrate on its impending approval with a big ol picture of a cat.
00:06:52 [W] Finally.
00:06:53 [W] Let's talk about something a little different. Let's talk about Doom
00:06:58 [W] Wait what I'm a sucker for hard transitions in this talk, but hopefully I've gained your trust enough to allow me to bring this back around.
00:07:08 [W] Doom is an iconic video game and one of the original first-person shooters.
00:07:12 [W] So what does slaying demons on Mars have to do with kubernetes?
00:07:17 [W] Well someone with as sick a sense of humor is I have thought it would be a fun idea to take doom and make it into the most violent chaosmesh engineering tool ever.
00:07:27 [W] It's impractical, but you can't argue that it doesn't sound fun.
00:07:33 [W] And again though its practicality is limited the fact that someone plumbed this all the way through and probably it was probably driven by their need for a fun project and it's these types of projects that most certainly teach lessons along the
00:07:48 [W] like fun drives innovation
00:07:33 [W] These weren't just a Showcase of silly things by the way, but our communities would not be the same without them.
00:07:39 [W] In fact, I'd like to argue that each of these in its own right benefited the communities in more than one way.
00:07:48 [W] This is one of my favorite pictures.
00:07:50 [W] It's a shot from the 2019 North America kubernative contributor Summit the same one with all the hats in the honks.
00:07:57 [W] This isn't just a community. This is a group of close-knit welcoming and loving friends.
00:08:04 [W] And so some may think that these are just inside jokes or you'd have to have been there.
00:08:09 [W] That's simply not true.
00:08:10 [W] And in fact, it's the opposite each of these examples made the community more accessible than it was before by embracing the breadsticks locking made the release team feel more fun and inviting to many that were outside and
00:08:25 [W] Applying to be a shadow for the 116 release team people on that 116 release are to this day heavily involved in Sig release and they feel strong connection to the community.
00:08:22 [W] Cards Against containers besides being a fantastic marketing. It takes the simple yet fun format of Cards Against Humanity and injects that cloud native flare into it.
00:08:33 [W] It's another activity that whenever in person events resume strangers can sit down and play and immediately feel connected with one another.
00:08:45 [W] You wouldn't think that a hashtag on Twitter would really have a wild impact, but I know for a fact it did the thread started small and wound up so big multiple threads had to start because the limit of people on a reply was hit on Twitter anyone could hop
00:09:00 [W] You wouldn't think that a hashtag on Twitter would really have a wild impact, but I know for a fact it did the thread started small and wound up so big multiple threads had to start because the limit of people on a reply was hit on Twitter anyone could hop
00:09:14 [W] Toss out a pun or a Star Trek kubernative joke and Bam welcome to the community and I said that it had an impact. I know of several current contributors that really integrated into the community with this thread being the Catalyst one of which even
00:09:29 [W] I know several current contributors that really integrated into the community with this thread being the Catalyst one of which even warmed up overnighting those stickers for Kube con Valerie.
00:09:39 [W] I love you.
00:09:40 [W] Thank you for that.
00:09:41 [W] that. I have one on my laptop.
00:09:44 [W] So how do bots have such a large impact? Well Automation in the kubernative community is almost a mean and contributing to the project. Unfortunately doesn't have a very low bar to entry part of that has to do with the many different / commands
00:09:59 [W] Almost a mean and contributing to the project unfortunately doesn't have a very low bar to entry part of that has to do with the many different / commands.
00:10:09 [W] We use within GitHub a simple / wolf or / Pony.
00:10:13 [W] Ye is a gateway to people seeing and understanding that automation.
00:10:17 [W] Oh and you want to write your own Pro plugin. Well, let me show you this lovely and simple example that posts a goose picture when you type / goose.
00:10:25 [W] or slash honk
00:10:28 [W] all of this comes right back to honk CTL a goose themed security Capture the Flag or CTF based around kubernative eyes and fun and silly objectives.
00:10:38 [W] It evolved quickly in a short amount of time going from one night of hacking with the Twitter API.
00:10:45 [W] to the next night Alex Ellis installing inlets on to my poor laptop and finding my IP address and asking what the weather was in my state and actually a little bit more narrow than that that made me belly laugh, but only after I shut down the
00:11:00 [W] My router because that was a little scary but fun.
00:11:03 [W] We iterated fast.
00:11:06 [W] I involved Bob as I do with any of my crazy ideas and we both had a lot of fun doing it.
00:11:11 [W] We let anyone in everyone join in to try and break kubernative.
00:11:15 [W] Jailbreak out of our game even and just enjoy themselves in a kubernative sandbox with no real rules.
00:11:21 [W] Some of the honk CTL games were multiplayer with everyone interacting with the same cluster there were instances where we would actually have one or two.
00:11:29 [W] Good actors, trying to lock down the cluster to prevent Bad actors from doing anything.
00:11:34 [W] We're breaking the cluster. It was fantastic. The later ones removed a certain element of that chaos and provisioned minikube stirs for each participant and with that the game grew
00:11:46 [W] at the last challenge we ran into it was quite literally Untitled Goose game, but in kubernative through various pivoting through our back-end service accounts players had to make their way through several levels or namespaces to
00:12:01 [W] Bell many played but the dream team of Sig honk comprised of Ian bread giesemann and Duffy coolly were the first to complete it and several others finishing shortly after for the record Bob was the genius behind that last
00:12:04 [W] After for the record Bob was the genius behind that last Challenge and you can play it locally by installing kind and running the Manifest through the honk CTL repo.
00:12:02 [W] I will be demoing this in a bit.
00:12:03 [W] But this all comes to just like all the other examples I talked about with Community Fund honk CTL wasn't just silly fun or an inside joke.
00:12:16 [W] It was a way to make kubernative security more accessible and be used as both a Sandbox and a teaching tool when you can take a complex topic or a subject with a high bar for entry and make it extremely easy to explore and break things without
00:12:31 [W] People's curiosity will take over.
00:12:33 [W] I remember as a kid.
00:12:35 [W] I was lucky enough to have a computer growing up but my parents were always extremely worried about breaking it just by clicking the wrong thing and I feel like if they'd had more of a Sandbox or controlled environment where they could explore without any repercussions.
00:12:51 [W] Technology wouldn't have been so difficult for them to adopt.
00:12:50 [W] So if you can give someone like that sandbox or just that little bit of structure or a goal to strive towards it'll help them learn and they won't really realize how much they're learning.
00:13:02 [W] So with that.
00:13:05 [W] I want to go over the last tongue CTL challenge.
00:13:08 [W] What does one of these games look like?
00:13:09 [W] Well, let's spin it up and see how it looks first off.
00:13:14 [W] This assumes.
00:13:15 [W] You have golang Docker and get installed.
00:13:17 [W] I will not be going over those but we will go from there. So that includes installing Cube Cube cuddle and kind and then let's just Dive Right In.
00:13:28 [W] All right.
00:13:30 [W] So first we are going to get the latest version of cubicle.
00:13:35 [W] These instructions are on the kubernative website. And if you Google install Cube cuddle, you will get that just fine.
00:13:42 [W] I'm pretty much just going to copy and paste these so we've downloaded the binary.
00:13:47 [W] Next we want to make sure that we can execute it.
00:13:51 [W] And then last we need to move it so it's in our path.
00:14:01 [W] Now if we do a keep cuddle version we see that we are using 119 3 which should be the latest and I don't have any existing server configured.
00:14:10 [W] fine
00:14:14 [W] and then if we run a kind version we see that we now have version .9 though. I'm not going to go over this.
00:14:21 [W] I will say for daily driving with Cube cuddle and interacting with kubernetes clusters. And especially when you were dealing doing the existing challenge. I'm going to show the Casey TX or cube cuddle
00:14:36 [W] The Cayenne S or cube cuddle namespace plugins are invaluable because you can do KN s and it'll list all the namespaces. You can also do Casey TX and list all of your context very very helpful.
00:14:40 [W] Going to go over them.
00:14:34 [W] I just wanted to shout them out. So next what I said was we need to go and get the public version of the honk CTL repo.
00:14:43 [W] repo. So we'll just go and get clone that this is a public repo with all of the previous challenges and notes and the solution if you get stuck or you just kind of want to skip the fun and see the the end goal.
00:14:58 [W] next we need to go into the
00:15:04 [W] Challenges directory find the March Challenge and then the next thing we do is we create a cluster using kind we specify a config in the challenge because we need
00:15:19 [W] Features in order to lock down the cluster the way we needed to for this challenge.
00:15:24 [W] Do a little dance watch Cube up keep cuddle tonight.
00:15:31 [W] That's that's all I had.
00:15:32 [W] But once this is up, we need to apply there are three different folders full of manifests and we need to apply them in order.
00:15:41 [W] So that's why it's manifest 0 manifest or sorry manifest one Manifesto to and Manifesto three sweet. So if we do,
00:15:53 [W] We see that we have a server version and a client version and if we do a cube cuddle get nodes, we should see honk CTL control plane.
00:16:01 [W] Excellent.
00:16:02 [W] So next what we'll do is like I said, we will keep cuddle apply all of those manifests.
00:16:09 [W] PSPs worthy Alpha feature that we needed to enable by the way.
00:16:17 [W] and then keep cuddle apply Manifesto 3
00:16:23 [W] Beautiful the last step to start the challenge is to run a script that is also in the repo called gusta. Sh what this is going to do is it is going to essentially when you create a kind cluster
00:16:39 [W] Stir admin on that cluster. This will change all of the context that are needed and you will wind up in a garden as a Goose.
00:16:37 [W] That's why it's called gustad.
00:16:39 [W] Sh. So once all that has happened to verify that everything is good do Cube cuddle get nodes.
00:16:49 [W] You should be forbidden from getting nodes. In fact, you can see that you are now the service account of goose and you were in a
00:16:58 [W] Ian
00:17:00 [W] And if you get cold gun pods, no resources are found in the garden namespace.
00:17:05 [W] So that is how you start the last challenge. You can do this on your own locally as I've shown but I do want to give people a little bit of a hint on where to start because as I explained with Untitled Goose game, you have a to-do
00:17:20 [W] And if you look in this challenge, there are two dues.
00:17:06 [W] And if you look at the two dues.
00:17:11 [W] There happened to be some to do that.
00:17:13 [W] You need to follow so
00:17:16 [W] Let's review what it took to get to this point. So you can play around verify that you have Cube cuddling kind installed clone down the repo and then these instructions are also in the repo just doing three
00:17:31 [W] And then running the goose script to give someone a Sandbox game where they have to learn how to Pivot through different are back rules.
00:17:27 [W] That's not a low bar to entry I think so.
00:17:32 [W] That's that.
00:17:36 [W] Are we go?
00:17:39 [W] Yeah, so it seems like this honk thing is here to stay many have and continue to Rally behind it a full year later.
00:17:47 [W] We're still flocking behind the banner of a goose.
00:17:50 [W] I for one am extremely excited for Sig honks panel.
00:17:53 [W] I highly suggest everyone attend who can I know they're keynoting and I believe yep. I am before them.
00:18:00 [W] So please go watch them and give them some love.
00:18:05 [W] And speaking of Sig honk 2020 has been a wild ride for many myself included between virtual burnout and silly things like contacts.
00:18:15 [W] It's been tough to line things up for the next challenge and the next challenge was a rather interactive attack and defend challenge involving Sig honk. It hasn't gotten scheduled yet what I can say, we've
00:18:30 [W] We want to make it happen this year.
00:18:25 [W] It won't disappoint.
00:18:26 [W] We just need to you know, get get life to slow down, hopefully.
00:18:35 [W] So with all that said let's brainstorm another game.
00:18:38 [W] Let's think about a game that's been skyrocketing in popularity for the last couple of months.
00:18:43 [W] It's a low bar to entry the rules are simple, but it has unlimited potential and fun.
00:18:49 [W] It's something that we could build our next challenge or teaching tool or it's Among Us.
00:18:55 [W] Us. I'm going to make a game based on Among Us now.
00:19:00 [W] Among Us for those of you that don't know is a game much like Mafia or werewolf in the game you and a team of others must run around and try to complete tasks on a map.
00:19:10 [W] Everyone is given a different task lists some overlap and while people are doing tasks.
00:19:16 [W] No one is allowed to talk.
00:19:17 [W] However among you maybe one or two evil imposters whose sole Mission it is to so Mayhem and eliminate all the other crew members in the game The Imposter.
00:19:29 [W] Win if the number of alive imposters becomes equal to the number of alive crew members the crew mates win if they can complete all their tasks or if they eliminate all the imposters the crew can send people out the airlock by voting
00:19:44 [W] And so to speak during these crew meetings people can talk argue debate or stay silent.
00:19:37 [W] It's all about tactics and sussing out who's not doing tasks.
00:19:41 [W] It is a hilariously fun game and I will be happy to play with anyone who thinks. Yep. I can betray my friends in light of their face.
00:19:49 [W] So how can we turn among us into a cloud knative fueled game? Well, let's think about what if you had to keep a workloads alive by
00:20:00 [W] defying malicious or misconfigured components running inside your cluster.
00:20:04 [W] The idea would involve things like adding disruption budgets or identifying workloads that could Kuma node.
00:20:11 [W] This isn't multiplayer, but it becomes a fantastic tool for people new to kubernative applications and fault tolerance to learn common patterns and best practices while having some fun.
00:20:23 [W] Instead of Among Us.
00:20:24 [W] It's disrupt us a wacky game of intrigue and workloads management.
00:20:29 [W] So you see all these copy pastas on Twitter lately with like fill in the blank after typing this phrase. And then I look at this one.
00:20:39 [W] I can't even imagine what many people would finish this with Cloud native Computing is complex unachievable boring.
00:20:48 [W] I want to change that cloud native Computing is
00:20:52 [W] other
00:20:40 [W] all I want to do is have fun with all of my friends all of you.
00:20:44 [W] And the more fun we have together the closer we become and the further we can go.
00:20:50 [W] So what can we build together?
00:20:52 [W] What silly crazy fun ideas do you have please tell me and let's have some fun.
00:21:01 [W] Thank you.
00:21:01 [W] Thank you for listening to me rant and talk about games and Cloud native stuff.
00:21:06 [W] Thank you for participating in honk CTL and other gu see things in the community.
00:21:11 [W] Just thank you because without you I wouldn't be having as much fun as I have.
00:21:16 [W] I will be around on the internet pretty much Ad nauseam.
00:21:21 [W] I should be around after this talk when this talk is broadcast.
00:21:25 [W] Feel free to reach out to me. Even if you want to just throw an idea my way, please
00:21:31 [W] Let's have some fun together and thank you.
00:21:38 [W] There I am.
00:21:39 [W] Hey, hello everybody.
00:21:42 [W] I am I'm the one that just talked for 25 minutes on video games and honks. If you have questions, feel free to put them in this QA if you just want to you know
00:21:57 [W] Air I am hey, hello everybody.
00:21:56 [W] .
00:21:58 [W] I am I'm the one that just talked for 25 minutes on video games and honks. If you have questions, feel free to put them in this QA if you just want to you know blast the Q&A with honks, I fully expect that as well.
00:22:13 [W] In fact, I almost encourage it. But yeah, so there's also the hashtag
00:22:21 [W] Pound 2 Cube con Community slack that's where I am honking about a bunch. Also the for keep con hallway channel has been fantastic.
00:22:33 [W] Please please go there as well.
00:22:35 [W] We've been chilling.

00:24:50 [W] Especially if we could like and like you servicemeshcon Dove the way that we're connecting things.
00:24:57 [W] I think that would be a very novel and kind of cute way to start teaching people more about like servicemeshcon.
00:25:08 [W] I'm literally going through top-down Nick Young. I am I'm an awful person, especially since I'm a moderator and I'm not actually reading the questions out.
00:25:16 [W] I'm so sorry.
00:25:17 [W] Nick Young asked. Did you see the killing your pods with doom thing?

00:26:33 [W] There is a Twitter account.
00:26:34 [W] It is at honk - see I follow that whenever we do different games that's typically where we're going to announce them.
00:26:42 [W] You can also follow me, but I tend to not necessarily tweet just about the games.
00:26:47 [W] I'm kind of all over the place Pete points out of
00:26:50 [W] ER visualizer to seen nodes or pods inside the containers are sorry.
00:26:57 [W] No, it's pods inside the nodes containers inside.

00:27:40 [W] I don't know how that would work.
00:27:42 [W] There is also a Minecraft one.
00:27:45 [W] That could be a fun CTF Ian.
00:27:46 [W] Let's talk the moderator actually asked serious question.
00:27:56 [W] How do we help on board new folks a new meme database?
00:28:01 [W] There is also a Minecraft one. That could be a fun CTF Ian.

00:28:14 [W] How do we help on board new folks a new meme database?
00:28:18 [W] I don't know.
00:28:19 [W] It's interesting because all of the like inside jokes and memes that I referenced with they stick around like they're still around and available. So I
00:28:30 [W] I think we've gotten big enough to actually have a database.
00:28:35 [W] Bob suggest that we could adapt unreal tournaments face map and then each cat each flag cap takes out a pod.
00:28:43 [W] That's that's cute.
00:28:44 [W] I mean Wiki, yes Ian.
00:28:48 [W] That's fantastic idea Nick suggest a cleaner Urban Dictionary for kubernative.

00:28:56 [W] All right, y'all this has been such a wonderful time you make
00:29:04 [W] I'm not even kidding. You make me want to do this more and you make this all worth it.
00:29:09 [W] I wasn't kidding when I said this talk was a love letter to everybody because without this community like Cloud native would not be as strong as powerful or as influential as it is and it's all thanks to you
00:29:25 [W] App. I think I need to piece out because it may or may not have honked myself calendar-wise and I'm supposed to go moderate Stevens release engineering talk in 15 minutes.
00:29:36 [W] Yeah, so thank you everybody.
