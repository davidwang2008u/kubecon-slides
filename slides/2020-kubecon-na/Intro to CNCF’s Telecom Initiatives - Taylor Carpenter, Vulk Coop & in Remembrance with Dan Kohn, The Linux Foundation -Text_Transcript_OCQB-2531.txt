00:00:00 [W] Hi and welcome.
00:00:01 [W] Trying to bridge those gaps and help Telco M service providers on their journey to being more Cloud native.
00:00:08 [W] I'm Taylor Carpenter and owner and the software Cooperative. Look Co-op based out of Austin, Texas.
00:00:17 [W] I've been in open-source Advocate and Linux user since the mid-90s doing telephony development since early 2000s and helping cncf since 2017.
00:00:30 [W] Dan Khan spearheaded these Telco ministers. He's the VP of strategic programs were cncf in the general manager of Linux Foundation Public Health.
00:00:42 [W] After the introduction will go through some of the guiding principles more in depth for each one of the initiatives talk about how you can get involved and then we'll have an interactive Q&A and discussion.
00:00:52 [W] Feel free to add your questions and comments now for the QA we'll get to those during that portion will be available to chat more after the session on cncf slack and you can find these slides available
00:01:08 [W] The cncf community has continued to rapidly grow with new projects members and end users as organizations around the world continue to adopt Cloud knative Technologies.
00:01:20 [W] These organizations are seeking to gain the benefits of others are already experiencing with cost Savings in capex and Opex as well as improvements and availability resiliency for their platforms and applications.
00:01:34 [W] action workloads alike as well as higher development velocity and both
00:01:41 [W] There's a large number of Technology choices available along with these Cloud native methodologies that Telco scan benefit from and choose from and cncf some period of is to help tone goes navigate this vast landscape.
00:01:56 [W] These organizations are seeking to gain the benefits of others are already experiencing with cost savings and capex and Opex as well as improvements and availability resiliency for their platforms and application workloads alike.
00:03:39 [W] And as soon as service providers in obtaining the benefits touted by all these Cloud native Technologies.
00:03:47 [W] So it's created three Telco Minish toves the Telco Lon user group The CNF test bed and cncf conformance.
00:03:58 [W] The Telco M. User group is a collaborative space that welcome service providers vendors and Telco M developers to come together. Share our ideas. Ask questions voice their needs and concerns.
00:04:13 [W] That welcome service providers vendors and tell Cam developers to come together share our ideas.
00:04:20 [W] Ask questions voice their needs and concerns.
00:04:26 [W] Come up with best practices and require permits found within the planet of community brought up requirements from the Telco M to Maine.
00:04:36 [W] The CNF test bed is a open source platform tool chain and set of examples help review the cloud native tekton acknowledge.
00:04:46 [W] He's reproduce test results create new reference examples and the CNF conformance is a test Suite to validate the Telco map applications or Cloud native Network functions as well as
00:05:01 [W] Technologies reproduce test results create new reference examples and the CNF conformance is a test Suite to validate the Telco map applications or cloudevents work
00:05:29 [W] Platforms and it infrastructure is adherence to Cloud native principles.
00:05:37 [W] All of these initiatives share guiding ideal starting with the cloud native principles themselves, including all the fundamental concepts that go find underneath those service Discovery loose coupling
00:05:52 [W] Sure, these principles build on existing methodologies and practices such as those found in devops service space architecture agile software development and even Unix philosophy.
00:06:10 [W] We also care deeply about Community collaboration. So we engage and work with communities found within elephan other parts of Linux Foundation of course cncf self and kubenetes initiatives and
00:06:25 [W] And those outside like oh ran in the open air initiative software Alliance different providers like equinix AWS.
00:06:28 [W] We also work with Telco M service providers directly in the developers of the different solutions.
00:06:37 [W] Within the Telco music group, we invite all of these different users and communities to come in and share their ideas.
00:06:44 [W] Look at technology that's been presented at the different meetings.
00:06:50 [W] Voice the different concerns.
00:06:54 [W] We've created a cloud knative thinking for telecommunication white papers that looks at the aspirations for the telecommunication industry what they could stay as they adopt more and more in Cloud native. We contribute to a larger
00:07:09 [W] Knative networking papers that we'll talk about more later.
00:07:08 [W] With the CNF confirm its initiative their shared effort surround identifying maintaining Claudette of requirements for those applications platforms defined definitions. Like what is a cncf and what does it mean to be
00:07:24 [W] Nats conformance program we have many different members including service providers like AT&T and Charter Verizon Bell, Canada and vendors like Nokia.
00:07:28 [W] Juniper and as well as projects and communities from different organizations.
00:07:35 [W] We welcome your participation.
00:07:36 [W] It meets on the first Monday of the month with alternating times the next one being December 7th at 1500 UTC.
00:07:45 [W] We also have a mailing list which you can join you can view the last recordings and you can view the different efforts.
00:07:54 [W] We put at other conferences like the open network and Edge Summit where we brought in six cncf projects that did presentations on how
00:08:05 [W] Those Technologies can be used to solve Telco and Edge problems with their Solutions.
00:08:12 [W] You can see those an LS playlist there.
00:08:18 [W] The CNF test bed is an open source set of software and Frameworks for reviewing these emerging Cloud native Technologies within the Telco NG domain.
00:08:29 [W] bare metal on demand Hardware
00:08:32 [W] As a Innovation review tool it's focused on supporting different technology options.
00:08:38 [W] trying to keep things as uncomplicated as is reasonable so that you can go in and understand the different components. We can plug in different options.
00:08:48 [W] We try to use Upstream tolling like Cube spray and nfv bench so that if you understand those then you can understand them here and we can also contribute back to those communities.
00:09:00 [W] The examples go from very minimal ones so that you can understand a part at a simple stage all the way through service chaining of different type of applications in the Telecom and different use cases. You may see
00:09:16 [W] We try to focus bring Focus to anything that is doing well as well as those that we think there may be gaps in.
00:09:26 [W] To be reproducible.
00:09:28 [W] We try to follow those Cloud native principles on all levels.
00:09:31 [W] So that means immutable Hardware configuration for the underlying physical machines as well as the underlying Network all of that saved and configuration within the test, but it's self.
00:09:45 [W] Focus bring Focus to anything that is doing well as well as those that we think there may be gaps in
00:09:51 [W] To be reproducible.
00:09:53 [W] We try to follow those Cloud native principles on all levels.
00:09:56 [W] So that means immutable Hardware configuration for the underlying physical machines as well as the underlying Network all of that saved and configuration within the test fit itself.
00:10:12 [W] The provisioning and bootstrapping is repeatable and automation of desire and we try to use as many inbound or kubernative knative components as possible.
00:10:22 [W] We also Expose and show how we can do integration with providers like equinix for provisioning the hardware and network infrastructure and all those different layers.
00:10:34 [W] We try to keep Loosely coupled so that we can plug in different things and you can understand how they fit together.
00:10:40 [W] There's a lot of documentation over the examples how the different layers work and all the configuration again is open and available in the repository itself.
00:10:51 [W] We've have contributions from many different projects and communities different vendors such as red hat Samsung VMware Network servicemeshcon the cncf FTI over M. The elephant communities.
00:11:07 [W] Vendors such as red hat Samsung VMware Network servicemeshcon the cncf FD io4 the elephant communities.
00:11:17 [W] We'd love to have your participation.
00:11:19 [W] You can come and access any of the source code documentation configuration on the repository on GitHub. And if you have an API key from equinix, you can deploy the test but itself
00:11:33 [W] And then if you package up any of your applications, you can run those right on an instance of the test bed.
00:11:40 [W] We'd love to see any results or feedback on what you found. And if you'd like to contribute directly, we would be happy to see new issues or pull request improving the tool chain adding new examples
00:11:56 [W] you like
00:11:59 [W] the CNF conformance initiative has a focus on testing the applications and the underlying platforms for Telco x + bi applications were usually thinking plot native
00:12:14 [W] Plot knative Network functions and these are used within the workloads on top of bonds and it tries to provide visibility on how well they're following Cloud native principles and kubernative knative type of best
00:12:17 [W] And it tries to provide visibility on how well they're following Cloud native principles and kubernative knative type of best practices and principles.
00:12:26 [W] It's based on the concepts from of the kubernative conformance initiatives and the sauna boy project.
00:12:35 [W] the kubernative conformance is concerned with interoperability with the core kubernetes and we look from the platform side on what are best practices.
00:12:46 [W] Has that encourage interoperability and usability from Beyond the the base core platform.
00:12:56 [W] So all the add-ons and extensions provisioning down below kubernative that could look into other ways of provisioning hardware and then at the workloads itself those applications and we take the concepts
00:13:11 [W] On some extensions provisioning down below kubernative that could look into other ways of provisioning hardware and then at the workloads itself those applications and we take the concepts from
00:13:26 [W] Sit easier to run a t-test and we've developed a suite that that focuses on the usability there and exposing what we are looking at for conformance again back to the slides earlier
00:13:40 [W] Working with the Telco music group and taking feedback.
00:13:44 [W] It's now been integrated with the elephant's what was called the saint TT initiative where service providers and vendors are coming together to build a reference architecture and doing testing.
00:13:57 [W] It's now running within the elephant's openfaas test framework for running different test Suites to test some of the workloads.
00:14:07 [W] We plan on adding platform testing continuing to add more support for cncf switch those service providers.
00:14:14 [W] the nurse care about
00:14:17 [W] we cover many different tests categories within CNF confirm instana.
00:14:47 [W] Don't configuration right now resilience.
00:14:50 [W] This is a snapshot there's many more tests that are coming lots of ideas.
00:14:56 [W] Us we do those on both the workload and infrastructure platform side.
00:14:58 [W] These their requirements behind the tests that we're covering in the tests themselves those ideas they come from many different places we go back and look at what is the kubernative sand cncf
00:15:13 [W] As ideas, they come from many different places we go back and look at what is the kubernative sand cncf doing for Best Practices?
00:15:17 [W] What do we want to cover their?
00:15:19 [W] What are the type of things that tell Cam service providers and developers are needing and wanting what are those type of business underlying business requirement and the technology that they're looking at covering the CNT T
00:15:34 [W] Looking at covering the CNT T Community has a large set of requirements and then we lean into the cloud knative principles themselves. We do this and try to meet those those in user needs.
00:15:49 [W] And try to meet those those in user needs by sorting through and building up the requirements and then prioritizing those tests.
00:16:02 [W] If you'd like to use the CNF conformance test Suite we have an extensive set of documentation starting from QuickStart type guides all the way through source-based insulation covering different requirements.
00:16:14 [W] And then we have usage instructions that go from running the entire Suite all the way through running individual tests. You can turn on debugging at different levels or get down to just a set of results which we see here
00:16:30 [W] The workloads test when you pass the workload command, you could see a set of tests on your console with the different past failures. And then at the end you will have a final score with all of the test results
00:16:45 [W] To a beginner maken file, which you can consume or read directly.
00:16:48 [W] We have a lot of contributors right now from different communities and projects, but we would love to see more if you'd like to participate.
00:16:57 [W] We have a contributing guide this again is all open source the configuration in the software to use it.
00:17:06 [W] We use a lot of Upstream tolling. So if you're familiar with any of the different security testing chaosmesh and you can come in and contribute you just have ideas or requirements.
00:17:18 [W] Love to see those you can open pull request or open new issues.
00:17:25 [W] For all of these cncf Telco initiatives would love for you to stay connected.
00:17:30 [W] We have regular meetings on the technical side.
00:17:33 [W] We have a thirst a meeting for the CNF confirm its and testbed meeting at 1415 UTC every Thursday the Telco music group again meets on the first Monday. So alternating times. The next one is on December 7th.
00:17:49 [W] For all of these students have Telco initiatives would love for you to stay connected.
00:17:52 [W] We have regular meetings on the technical side.
00:17:56 [W] We have a thirst a meeting for the CNF confirm its and testbed meeting at 1415 UTC every Thursday the Telco music group again mates on the first Monday. So alternating times. The next one is on December 7th.
00:18:29 [W] Across Community cncf permits meeting is currently meeting on Tuesdays 1600 UTC.
00:18:39 [W] We're on cncf slack for the conformance test bed and the Telco music group.
00:18:45 [W] There's a telecom User Group mailing list.
00:18:47 [W] We're also available on Twitter and GitHub.
00:18:52 [W] These slides are available on sched.
00:18:56 [W] Will be available on slack again to continue after the session.
00:19:02 [W] We welcome your feedback on this presentation, but especially on cncf Tuckerman issues on how we can help.
00:19:10 [W] On your journey to being more Cloud native.
00:19:14 [W] We're going to go into the Q&A session now.
00:19:17 [W] I thank you all for your participation and I look forward to working with you.
00:19:22 [W] Thank you so much.
00:19:32 [W] Hello.
00:19:43 [W] right
00:19:44 [W] Cncf site as well and in any of the project channels or the cube Khan Channel.
00:19:52 [W] So I see some.
00:19:55 [W] There's a couple of questions from Jim leaguer.
00:20:01 [W] And the first one is
00:20:08 [W] It's asking about.
00:20:15 [W] maybe the
00:20:46 [W] I'm getting a couple of messages on the audio.
00:20:48 [W] Let me if it goes bad. I can I can re say this, but I'm going to continue for now. So
00:21:09 [W] I'm getting a couple of messages on the audio.
00:21:11 [W] Let me if it goes bad. I can I can re say this, but I'm going to continue for now. So
00:21:21 [W] the we've been working with with all these different communities since the cncf started working with focusing on Telco mom starting with the CNF test bed and
00:21:56 [W] And when that started the a lot of the initial work was actually directly going out and working with groups like a nap and different elephant projects
00:22:11 [W] and the cset lab that does performance testing the app using PPP and folks from Cisco and other places and and reaching out to other non LF communities as well and that's continued
00:22:27 [W] along the whole path with all these other initiatives now within cncf and I would say the main reason why we want to have
00:22:42 [W] focused groups and projects and communities within cncf is to make sure that the cncf as a whole the different projects kubernative is getting the feedback from
00:22:57 [W] Goes but being able to absorb it and and try to ensure that the features and enhancements that would go into kubernative take those into consideration.
00:23:02 [W] And I'd say the main difference would be the approach for solving the problems.
00:23:08 [W] So when you look at something like what does elephant doing with what's called anacott now, which was CN t t+ o PN Fe and that was that's that's really a
00:23:22 [W] Say what you could think of as an opinionated approach.
00:23:26 [W] So there's there's different kubernative distributions, essentially and what anicut is as doing or what openfaas merger there is
00:23:41 [W] Building a Telco focused kubernative type of distribution with a lot of focus on trying to pick different pieces that they have experience with and that's a positive
00:23:51 [W] Some people want to come and find that and what cncf sap roach and I'm not going to look at all of them.
00:23:50 [W] I mean we could look at tip and that I Triple E initiatives and there's all sorts of other stuff that's happening behind the Saints and and different folks are engaged in all of the different ones, but the way cncf looks at
00:24:05 [W] The way cncf looks at staff is there's a lot of different options versus saying if you look at say the troll Map There's different options there but a better one would be looking at the landscape.
00:24:15 [W] So trying to give a view of the many different options that are available in open source, and then trying to select the ones that are following.
00:24:25 [W] Maybe a shared type of of viewpoint on how you implement and manage and and and do development on these type of software and infrastructure.
00:24:39 [W] So it's more of it's just a different way of coming about it that cncf does but there's direct collaboration.
00:24:47 [W] I'm that one's a pretty big question.
00:24:50 [W] So I'm hoping Jim that that kind of answered some of that and that does tie a little bit into your other.
00:24:56 [W] I'm just going to answer this next one from you Jim as well.
00:25:00 [W] It was so regarding the confirm conformance testing.
00:25:05 [W] Why is why are we looking at cncf having a different new type of test separate from one openfaas was doing or is doing with the
00:25:16 [W] Ovhcloud Ram. So weirder actually directly working with them and and there are there's folks that I've been working with for the last year, but especially
00:26:07 [W] Go for cncf and cncf is looking at more of an upstream set that's talking about kubenetes, maybe kubernative best practices or another way would say is how do you use kubernative
00:26:22 [W] Go for cncf and cncf is looking at more of an upstream set that's talking about kubenetes, maybe kubernative best practices or another way would say is how do you use kubernative
00:26:37 [W] Most efficient way for cncf store these networking and Telco type applications and how would they follow kubernative sand Cloud knative best practices.
00:26:49 [W] that's kind of a superset versus openfaas going to go more into requirements that they found that get even more detailed or you could say there's performance things that they're going to look at.
00:27:02 [W] So there's collaboration between us but a little bit different on the some
00:27:07 [W] the end goals.
00:27:08 [W] But again, it's a pinion knative Focus where it's helpful if someone wants that and then the place where people are looking at I want to go all the cart might be a way of looking at it.
00:27:23 [W] It looks like my audio might be a problem for some folks.
00:27:29 [W] I can do I need to switch that.
00:27:34 [W] How's my audio?
00:27:49 [W] Okay, fine now, okay, so I'm going to try to go I see that there's another question here from Krishna any progress done to run VoIP sip RTP apps on kubernative
00:28:04 [W] Might be a way of looking at it.
00:28:08 [W] Looks like my audio might be a problem for some folks.
00:28:13 [W] I can do I need to switch that.
00:28:18 [W] How's my audio?
00:28:33 [W] Okay, fine now, okay, so I'm going to try to go I see that there's another question here from Krishna any progress done to run VoIP sip RTP apps on kubernative
00:29:40 [W] Coming networking challenges. So there's yours asking for Progress.
00:29:48 [W] I'd say there's a lot of there's a lot of progress but I don't I don't see anything right now that I'd say here's a solution if you're if you're running maybe traditional and RTP application or sip if you're looking at
00:30:03 [W] Another things there are solutions and there's probably people on on this session, but there's definitely in the different the groups that we were talking about including the Telco music group that
00:30:19 [W] Session but there's definitely in the different the groups that we were talking about including the Telco music group that I've put forward various examples including use cases that have
00:30:33 [W] forward various examples including use cases that have some proxies and and other things that are running sbc's but the
00:30:47 [W] I don't see anything right now.
00:30:48 [W] That's completely come together.
00:30:50 [W] I'd say right now is the time if you are interested in giving feedback, either on use cases that you see are challenging or if you have ideas then getting involved with the different ones.
00:31:05 [W] It's it's happening on Sig Network within cncf the Sig networking over in kubernative.
00:31:11 [W] There's conversations. They're going about this. There's
00:31:16 [W] A lot of things that I've seen on dealing with Port range has and how you're going to deal with that on the cube proxy and there's a lot of different talks that would affect this but I don't know if
00:31:31 [W] That could say here is a solution there.
00:31:35 [W] are there are solutions Network servicemeshcon them earlier that that would be they have different things there. But that's that's why it's a right now is just to get involved.
00:31:50 [W] All right.
00:31:56 [W] And I don't know where we are on time.
00:31:58 [W] I'm going to keep going through the questions here.
00:32:01 [W] So the slack Channel and there's a cube con that number 2 Cube con maintainer.
00:32:09 [W] I'll be in that select Channel after and several people that are engaged in the different initiatives will be in there.
00:32:19 [W] And let's see.
00:32:23 [W] So there's a question about saying great presentation.
00:32:29 [W] Thank you. Appreciate it.
00:32:33 [W] Tag Telco music group also look into Edge Computing.
00:32:37 [W] So there's a question about saying great presentation.
00:32:33 [W] Thank you. Appreciate it.
00:32:36 [W] Tag Telco music group also look into Edge Computing.
00:32:41 [W] Yes, there have been discussions about that and we'll probably have kubenetes.
00:33:05 [W] About use cases and and one of the group's is Works directly on cubed.
00:33:14 [W] So I'm going to I think we're going to have more of those but the problems on cubed and some ways are not are the I guess discussions about how to do things haven't been as is
00:33:29 [W] Your badge and some ways or not.
00:33:34 [W] The I guess discussions about how to do things haven't been as is difficult in some of the areas to say. How would you do it on the Edge vs.
00:33:44 [W] In the core of of a at the Telco Telco core?
00:33:48 [W] And but anyways, yeah, we'll talk more about Edge and there's another on the cube concept Channel that's been given.
00:34:09 [W] I'm not sure. There's a someone saying 50% of previous answer is zero.
00:34:15 [W] is zero. I'm not sure what that is if you want to add some more comments.
00:34:21 [W] Let's see.
00:34:23 [W] Yeah, kubeedge apparently has there's session immediately after that once someone added Stephen Wang. Thanks and there.
00:34:30 [W] Yes, there is a kubernative styra to Edge working group on Friday.
00:34:38 [W] All right. I think that's the end of them trying to scroll through and see if there's anything else.
00:34:57 [W] we have about
00:34:59 [W] we have a few minutes left here.
00:35:03 [W] Channel
00:35:59 [W] All right, I guess that's it.
00:36:02 [W] I'll be on the cube con maintainer Channel.
00:36:06 [W] You can also find me in the CNF conformance and seeing if testbed channels and there is a new cncf working group Channel and tomorrow. We're doing a kickoff for the CNF working group,
00:36:22 [W] Is going to be focused on defining the conformance requirements that are being tested by the test Suite now and trying to get more collaboration directly on those requirements.
00:36:22 [W] So please join that kickoff meeting if you're available tomorrow.
00:36:25 [W] Thanks everyone. Have a good Cube con.
