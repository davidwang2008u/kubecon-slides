00:00:00 [W] Hi, so welcome to our talk.
00:00:03 [W] I walk through the kubernative you Islands Cape. My name is Ricky. I'm I work for Kinfolk as a director of product engineering and I'm here with Henning.
00:00:14 [W] Yes.
00:00:15 [W] My name is Hennig and I work for zalando great.
00:00:19 [W] So without further Ado, what are we here to talk about?
00:00:24 [W] So as you know kubernative is is a complex project and of course, you know people can use the cube CTL or keep control whatever you want to call it.
00:00:35 [W] But a way to make things simpler for everybody is to use graphical user interfaces.
00:00:40 [W] So there are lots of projects out there and we are here to talk about them.
00:00:46 [W] So we have we had to have some criteria in selecting those projects.
00:00:51 [W] And those are those have to be open source projects.
00:00:56 [W] They have to be under active development.
00:00:59 [W] So that means that they had a release in the last 12 months.
00:01:02 [W] They have to be used Standalone. So, you know not needing add-ons or control plane for them to to be usable and they can run off course.
00:01:15 [W] Either locally or in cluster, but they have to be just just that just running stand alone, and they have to have a graphical user interface.
00:01:25 [W] Yeah, some of the things we look into and we will mention this is the installation. So it's a project supposed to be running cluster or locally on your desktop or you know, does it have
00:01:40 [W] Multiple clusters support or does it only managed one cluster at a time?
00:01:46 [W] What is extensible or not read only or whether you can read and write and other things we'll talk about so you see these icons here.
00:01:55 [W] They will be on each slide in case we don't talk about this directly.
00:01:59 [W] You will know hopefully what it means.
00:02:01 [W] So let's start.
00:02:06 [W] Yes, let's start with Gwen datastax board next slides.
00:02:13 [W] So the official kubenetes dashboard is pretty old.
00:02:18 [W] It's compared to the other project.
00:02:21 [W] It's from 2015 first release 2016.
00:02:23 [W] It's a true you deploy to a single cluster and provides workloads overview for application developers your authenticate with a service account tone. So you do kubeflow GL.
00:02:35 [W] Proxy and then still need to copy the baritone into the first form. It provides some features like a king in two parts locks scaling workloads and editing your deployments.
00:02:49 [W] For example, it also provides a nice feature for searching across different workloads in the cluster so you can quickly find what you're looking for, but it has a overall a relatively limited set of features and it's not extensible. So overall
00:03:05 [W] I would say the orders are no official who we need. This dashboard is interesting to get an overview of workloads, but doesn't have too many features. You might need for further troubleshooting.
00:03:22 [W] Right. And by the way, do you think still that, you know being the official dashboard?
00:03:29 [W] Do you think it still lives up to do it's you know to its role or do you think people should look into other things now that we've looked into a bunch of stuff?
00:03:41 [W] I think it still makes sense to check out the kubernative dashboard, but it's there is a huge hurdle with the authentication. So it I think the project doesn't really know what it wants to be if it's now a local tool or something deployed. So you have to deploy to a cluster
00:03:56 [W] Cube config or a bearer token to authenticate. So it doesn't integrate with other authentication providers.
00:04:03 [W] So in this way, it's a little bit in between local and hosted Solutions.
00:04:10 [W] We will see later on.
00:04:13 [W] Right and the next one is actually, you know, it has many similarities with with the official kubernative dashboard.
00:04:22 [W] So it's also running cluster is also meant to to only managed one cluster and it's not extensible as well.
00:04:30 [W] So this is called Kate - and it started as a project by someone called Eric her Branson.
00:04:39 [W] I hope I pronounce his name correctly and
00:04:42 [W] It was stopped for a while, but then I think indeed took over and now it's managed by indeed still with with Eric on the project. As I as far as I can see, you know, this is an interesting project because like I said
00:04:57 [W] It's a good alternative to the official dashboard in my opinion.
00:04:53 [W] And it's also it also feels very lightweight. So, you know, the UI is kind of snap in comparison. At least last time. I checked both of them that said, of course the you I could maybe be a bit refined.
00:05:08 [W] From a design point of view or usability one nice thing that it has is that the editor shows documentation?
00:05:04 [W] So when you're editing some some resource you can and you don't remember exactly when what things go here and there you can just quickly look into it.
00:05:12 [W] Yeah and one things that well a difference that with with the official ones that it does not have clusters search and also when I tried it with a view only token
00:05:26 [W] And it kind of failed to start the you know the UI, but otherwise it's a it's a good project in my opinion. So you already mentioned some differences to the official kubernative dashboard.
00:05:42 [W] You know recommend, what would you install in your cluster?
00:05:40 [W] Just looking at these two?
00:05:42 [W] Yeah, at least from you know from when I tried the official one and gate - I would say I would go with gate - for the reasons I said, but also for example if you want to change something on
00:05:58 [W] It - for the reasons I said but also for example, if you want to change something on one of the projects, I think it should be easier to do it on Kate - just because the codebase seems you know.
00:06:05 [W] It's on Kate - just because the codebase seems you know a bit smaller than of course a project that has been here for a while like like the official kubernative dashboard.
00:06:15 [W] So yeah, I'll go with this one. I think yeah, let's have a look at another project cube is curious is quite different to the other two dashboards.
00:06:28 [W] We saw earlier because it's really about seeing app config and state and yeah a checking.
00:06:35 [W] And if the state is safe and following some of the rules you can Define in the rule editor integrated into this project.
00:06:44 [W] So it really helps you analyze your cluster.
00:06:46 [W] You can Define custom rules for example that you don't want to run Docker latest tag or special settings.
00:06:53 [W] For example, requiring memory limits, etcetera Etc. And you can also have custom marker icon.
00:06:59 [W] So I think this is a really interesting tool for for example platform teams to Define.
00:07:05 [W] Was and then check the cluster accordingly.
00:07:08 [W] another very interesting feature is time machine so you can go back and forth into in time and see when something changed and for example correlate this when with something going wrong in your cluster. So for example label added or removed etcetera the
00:07:24 [W] A cluster and it also has a stripped-down portable version because the time machine uses a mySQL database in the back end so you can use the portable version but then you don't have the time machine.
00:07:36 [W] Yeah, it's only a read-only to only single cluster extensible by these custom rules.
00:07:43 [W] Yeah, that certainly looks interesting.
00:07:45 [W] So my question is you you know, what do you think of this time machine feature in comparison with for example gitops?
00:07:54 [W] Which also give you like a way to see which operations happen?
00:07:58 [W] Yeah, I guess the time machine is a really interesting feature and it can really help to troubleshoot when something is going wrong and then checking what was changed in the cluster, but obviously like most of the changes should be done we are ci/cd.
00:08:13 [W] D and maybe gitops so all the changes should be tracked and get but you might also use something like postgres operator or other operator, which also changes cluster state. So the time machine would help you see these cluster safe State changes which are not reflected in
00:08:28 [W] That being said I never tried this time machine with a big cluster with many changes going on in many resources.
00:08:19 [W] So I'm not sure how the scales with the database great.
00:08:27 [W] Yes octane. That's pretty popular tool. It's only locally available.
00:08:33 [W] It was created by VMware.
00:08:34 [W] It has a quite nice UI and it's created for developers to better understand the complexity for of coredns.
00:08:42 [W] It has clusters.
00:08:42 [W] So you start a local to Tool and then see the UI in your browser and it has some interesting features like this object graph. So you see resources and connected resources like for the service Ingress Secret.
00:08:56 [W] Cetera and it has a very nice feature of port forwarding so you can go to a pot or a service and then enable port forwarding and you don't have to switch between command line or terminal and the browser because it directly
00:09:11 [W] did resources like for the service Ingress secret Etc and it has a very nice feature of port forwarding so you can go to a pot or a service and then enable port forwarding and you don't have to switch between
00:09:18 [W] And you can open the door. It also provides plugins.
00:09:23 [W] There was also a reason plug-in credit for Jenkins X.
00:09:26 [W] So if you use that may be worth checking out.
00:09:28 [W] that's a little bit sad that the tool doesn't have a global search. So you cannot just search for something in the in the cluster like what this integrated and kubernative dashboard and it provides access to multiple clusters you defined in Cube conflict, but it doesn't have any cross cluster features.
00:09:46 [W] Great, so see soaked and opens a browser window.
00:09:52 [W] So it's a local application but it does not ship. It's you know, it's on browser view or webview like others. Do you think this is an advantage or a disadvantage?
00:10:04 [W] I think it's both but I certainly can see some advantages.
00:10:08 [W] for example using bookmarks because if you use a standalone tools and you often yeah have not a feature of having bookmarks in the app itself and with octane. You have your normal browser. You can bookmark for example your deployment
00:10:23 [W] Usually look at and I think that's pretty neat so you can reuse features from the browser.
00:10:30 [W] Great, and the next one is actually similar in a way.
00:10:36 [W] So it's also an application that one runs locally.
00:10:39 [W] It's also multi cluster and it was actually a it's called lens and I it was actually a proprietary tool by a company called container, but the company did not succeed and at that time
00:10:55 [W] I think some of the employees made this project open source, and then mirantis as far as I understand purchased or acquired the assets from container and now we have an open source application.
00:10:54 [W] So like I said, this is this is similar to Auckland in a way that it runs locally, but it's a it's like a full application in a way that achieves its own web View and one thing that I really really like.
00:11:08 [W] is that the so they user interface and user experience is really nice.
00:11:12 [W] It you can access a lot of information but it all seems to be very well, you know in a good layout and very well thought of it also has like a Helm chart store. And another interesting thing. Is that
00:11:27 [W] Understand it ships Cube CTL with it.
00:11:26 [W] So you if you update the application you always have an updated keep CTL you can use the terminal right away from the application itself.
00:11:35 [W] So yeah, it does not really have cross cost of features.
00:11:39 [W] So no and also know like big search or anything and it's also not extensible. So it looks pretty polished lenses.
00:11:51 [W] Yeah, how would you compare two octant? Both tools are local so which one should I install and use?
00:11:58 [W] Yeah, so both are similar.
00:12:00 [W] that's true for me.
00:12:02 [W] I would probably go with lenses just because I think you know in terms of the UI it works really well and not only it looks good. But it actually you know, the way things are laid out again at the capabilities you have are really good.
00:12:18 [W] I would go with Lance for sure.
00:12:15 [W] Yeah, and the next project is a very curious one that is different from the rest.
00:12:20 [W] It's called Cube nav. And yeah, so this one works on your mobile phone on your mobile phone on your cluster and also on your desktop and it allows you to manage several clusters as well
00:12:36 [W] security is one not only because it allows all these but also because you know, it's a mobile-first in a way that as far as I understand they focus on the mobile experience first and this reflects on the desktop you why so if
00:12:42 [W] Your least some some of the resources available in the cluster.
00:12:41 [W] You don't see the typical table in there you rather see a list.
00:12:45 [W] So and this makes things a little bit more complicated to you know to understand sometimes list in my in my experience with it because you don't see like okay this column is about the the creation date you
00:13:01 [W] An entry in the in the entry itself of the of the list with the creation date or something.
00:13:04 [W] So the so so yeah, so there is that downside I would say but if you looking for something beyond the desktop, this would be a solution. I think one thing that was not clear was how to authenticate with
00:13:19 [W] It just took whatever was on the cube Karthik and also there is no clothes no cross cluster features. So Noble search.
00:13:27 [W] So do you think having a mobile app is it's important for like managing kubernative testers or workloads?
00:13:35 [W] I think that in times where where people can travel, you know, maybe it's important to have a way to just quickly check on your clusters when you when you are on the up in the airport or something,
00:13:50 [W] In times where where people can travel, you know, maybe it's important to have a way to just quickly check on your clusters when you when you are on the up in the airport or something, but I think that for day to day operations.
00:14:07 [W] For a day to day operations tool.
00:14:10 [W] I think of course, I would rather use something that focuses on an experience that we used to with the with a laptop or you know desktop computer.
00:14:24 [W] Yeah, so the next one I have to give a small disclosure first.
00:14:29 [W] So this is a this is a project I'm involved in. So this is a called headlamp and it's a project created by Kinfolk. You can run this project also locally as an application for
00:14:44 [W] Or also in the cluster it has multiple multi cluster support and one of its core features is that we have what we call front-end plugins so you can have a plug-in, you know, just let's say we don't have
00:14:59 [W] Is so let's say that you want to create a photograph you you can create a plug-in for that. And then the idea is that the plugins are actually outside of the of the cluster, right? So sorry of the of the UI.
00:15:03 [W] So when you start the the UI you can point it to directly with plugins and they will be available.
00:15:09 [W] Another thing. Is that the so all the cluster actions we have at the moment like editing for example deployment or something those have a grace period when you click apply.
00:15:22 [W] Why so if you are editing something and you click apply you you suddenly notice that you made a mistake you can just click cancel.
00:15:30 [W] So it gives you like a small grace period for you to kind of undo or cancel what you were about to do.
00:15:37 [W] Yeah. Another thing that I think it's makes for a good user experience is that we we don't assume that the users have full Administration capabilities in the cluster. So if you don't if you cannot really add it
00:15:53 [W] Resource because you don't have that role in a cluster.
00:15:56 [W] We don't show the the edit button or the delete button.
00:16:00 [W] For example.
00:16:00 [W] Yeah, and we do have like stuff like keyboard shortcuts and other features, but we do not have like across cluster search for example, even if we have multiple clusters support, so
00:16:16 [W] don't have
00:16:15 [W] so what was your motivation to create headlamp?
00:16:18 [W] Yeah, so Kinfolk has kubenetes distribution called locomotive.
00:16:23 [W] And at first of course, we wanted something that we could use as a your wife rate. So we looked into the existing projects and the idea was okay.
00:16:32 [W] We take one of these and we modified we keep a fork of it or we contribute what we can back but at the point at that point, we realized none of those projects actually had all that we wanted so we decided to create a project and
00:16:48 [W] Why a project but not one that was like intimate or very intimate with with locomotive instead.
00:16:54 [W] We wanted to create basically what we were looking for.
00:16:56 [W] So we created this project called headlamp and the idea is that for locomotive we will take this and we will you know, create a couple of plugins that will be more intimate with this project. So hopefully other people can you know use it as well.
00:17:14 [W] Okay. Next one is actually my project. I wrote a blog post last year about kubernative slap you eyes and I didn't really find what I was looking for.
00:17:24 [W] So I created kubernative map view.
00:17:25 [W] This is really focusing on read-only view for multiple clusters and advanced features.
00:17:31 [W] So I said it's kind of a cube CTL for the web and really for support and incident response.
00:17:37 [W] Always use permalinks to linked to certain thoughts or certain views or certain errors or locks and this just works across multiple clusters and uses plain HTML and CSS.
00:17:32 [W] that also is responsive. So you can also open this on your smartphone if you're traveling and it also has multi cluster feature so you can search for workloads across many clusters and it provides Advanced queries and
00:17:47 [W] You can quickly look for all nodes with a certain version or certain taint across many clusters.
00:17:41 [W] So the whole tool is customizable so you can adapt this with templating and seems and so on for your company needs and we have a deployed in the land. Also, I use it pretty frequently.
00:17:54 [W] it also provides like some power features like just download every view as a tab separated value file. So this is all kind of more like
00:18:03 [W] like plain and simple read-only access for multiple clusters.
00:18:09 [W] Great.
00:18:10 [W] So one of the of the reasons one of the differences with with the other Solutions we looked into is that this one is read-only right is is the read/write capability something you
00:18:25 [W] Or do you expect that to be added later?
00:18:19 [W] So my focus was really deploying this tool in a bigger corporate context something like Solano where we have a few thousand developers and like normal changes are done.
00:18:29 [W] We are ci/cd and gitops ratios as so I don't really want humans to interact with kubernative directly and change something and he's definitely not on production.
00:18:40 [W] So this view tool was really made for having a read-only view that being said it might make sense to have some write access for emergency situations in the
00:18:49 [W] Future but this is really not a focus or priority. So right now not really planned. Maybe I'll add something if I see this is really valuable for myself or others.
00:19:04 [W] Great.
00:19:05 [W] Yeah, and next we have a quick mention to about this project called canine. So this is a horrible meshmark because it does not really fit the criteria of having
00:19:20 [W] Face, but when Henning announced on Twitter that we were doing this talk many people came and said you have to check anynines.
00:19:18 [W] So yeah, so this is a like I said, this is a common line interface tool that I would say.
00:19:26 [W] It's like an extension to keep CTL if you want because it gives you like a quick UI with a listing all the all the resources you have. You can change them you can you know
00:19:40 [W] Describe them you can get a shell into them.
00:19:44 [W] But this is not a project that you have to either, you know, run locally as an application with the with a web view or hosting your cluster.
00:19:52 [W] So so yeah, it's also very customizable. If you want to create shortcuts keyboard shortcuts that is and anyway, it seems simple enough and besides and very importantly it has a great logo, too.
00:20:07 [W] So would you rather use to come on Madeline to like k-9s or lenses or octants for local as local to?
00:20:15 [W] So I think you know day-to-day I would use I would use you know, a graphical tool.
00:20:23 [W] So one that kind of guides me a bit better or a bit more graphically into what I need to do, but that said, you know canines seems like a very nice tool to just
00:20:36 [W] Just quickly run it and see what's up.
00:20:28 [W] But yeah for day-to-day I would go with the the full graphical solution.
00:20:36 [W] Okay, let's have a quick look at other you eyes.
00:20:39 [W] So we have some your eyes which were also mentioned to us, but they require a control plane or something else installed.
00:20:46 [W] So the Rancher dashboard you I actually looks pretty nice but it's not available stand alone right now. Gardna is mostly for managing clusters linkerd e and is too Oaky Ali or servicemeshcon, so you need them installed.
00:20:59 [W] we've scope is also pretty nice and but requires a probe app and Petain a is not really a
00:21:06 [W] When it has your eye, but now has kubernative support and requires some persistency.
00:21:14 [W] Yeah, there are also some other projects which are mentioned for example in my blog post last year. But some of them are now stay also constantly it is still cute men want to mention briefly because it has a very nice approach
00:21:30 [W] Tease so we can Define recipes for views and queries across clusters, but sadly not so stale Kubrick's stale kubernative.
00:21:40 [W] Okay, we had a look at a lot of different your eyes Yaki me also created your own your I also created one.
00:21:47 [W] So what would be your summary after looking through all these different rules?
00:21:52 [W] Yeah, so, you know definitely there are plenty of solutions out there for different use cases.
00:21:59 [W] And yeah, and for example, I'm very happy to see that lens made our you know our project overview.
00:22:10 [W] Which is something it would not have if it were still proprietary. But so I'm very happy that it became open source, and that also means that even if its original creators in the company or if the company is no longer around
00:22:25 [W] Live on and you know create value for for its users. One thing that I think it's curious that I noticed is that many of the of the projects.
00:22:22 [W] I tested just assume that you have like a full demonstration capabilities or full admin role in the in the cluster.
00:22:32 [W] whereas, you know, maybe have a company that is you know has to really review who can actually edit stuff.
00:22:42 [W] The update stuff and delete stuff. So she was curious to realize that and yeah, what do you think when your site?
00:22:51 [W] Yeah, I found it interesting that the two lenses Cape changes over time.
00:22:56 [W] we now have some stale projects which might be a little bit sad, but it's also nice to see new projects like Cube Neff. I only discovered as part of the preparations for this talk. So it's from this year. And yeah, maybe there are also new project in the future.
00:23:12 [W] Me personally, it's interesting to have this like one side of tools which are really used locally, like octant lenses k-9s and which is kind of personal preference like selecting your personal ID e, right so it's
00:23:27 [W] You don't necessarily want to prescribe this this local tools. And then there are the other side of tools you deploy actually to Cluster and it's really a difference whether you now choose a UI based on kind of your personal needs and maybe
00:23:30 [W] As for your own cluster or something you deploy into a cluster for your users, which also need to consider like you mentioned this limited cluster access and different rules and maybe just read only access etcetera.
00:23:28 [W] So in the land of we use kubernative Fu because it's created for many clusters and just read only access for thousands of developers, but this doesn't necessarily mean that it's the right tool for for your scenario.
00:23:41 [W] So definitely check check out these different tools and yeah you probably have
00:23:46 [W] Your list of requirements and needs to to evaluate the tools by yeah, and I hope that in that regard we gave a simple but you know, but useful overview of different tools
00:24:02 [W] You know check out the ones that need the control plane, if if if that's fine with your deployment to and and yeah, thank you very much for for attending and if you have questions we run.
00:24:13 [W] Thank you very much. Thank you.
00:24:26 [W] Okay.
00:24:27 [W] Hello everyone. So as you can see, this is already nighttime here.
00:24:32 [W] I'll just go with the one question and then you are key. Maybe you select one.
00:24:37 [W] So thanks.
00:24:40 [W] Someone says thank you.
00:24:40 [W] So as so many new questions coming in there was one question about thanks for putting this together.
00:24:49 [W] Are there any data points to show that engineer's would prefer using one of these your eyes versus using CLI. I
00:24:55 [W] That's a really interesting question, but I don't have any such data point.
00:24:59 [W] I think this is really depending on the use case. And if you have something like an Enterprise where you have a deployment for multiple developers or just for your home use, so yeah, if anybody has more data points happy to hear about it.
00:25:14 [W] Do you want to pick a question?
00:25:07 [W] we have so many how to
00:25:13 [W] All right, you can go to the next one hour. So I'll still looking into this.
00:25:19 [W] What is the most lightweight option to access the pazzi live you locks or execute commands inside the pods?
00:25:25 [W] That's one question from Nick Brown.
00:25:27 [W] Yeah, good question.
00:25:29 [W] Most of the tools. We showed today have some exact capability.
00:25:33 [W] I guess that's what the question is about.
00:25:34 [W] Also. The kubernative dashboard has exact probability also octant. So I would say really depends on what is the most lightweight option probably the most lightweight as using directly Cube CTR or k-9s as I said, I tool
00:25:48 [W] Yeah, but most of them provide XX.
00:25:58 [W] Yeah, if I if I can choose another one.
00:26:01 [W] Well, this is more like a comment, but I'll still address it.
00:26:05 [W] So it's about lenses announced extension API in Cube con 2020.
00:26:11 [W] Yeah, so we recorded this before that and that's why we kind of, you know measured in the in the video that there was no no extensions for lenses, but these are great news.
00:26:25 [W] Yeah, I agree.
00:26:26 [W] It said that it's gone, and then it's open source. So and now it becomes better.
00:26:19 [W] Any issues with using these UI tools installing on-prem against cloud-hosted kubernative for example gcp or will I need to be co-located with the classes in the cloud so I can't really answer this for all the tools.
00:26:31 [W] But at least for my own kubernative web view, you can certainly configure it.
00:26:36 [W] Oh, I see it's already partially answered from your Kim. So thanks for that.
00:26:45 [W] Yeah, you're welcome.
00:26:46 [W] Yeah, so hit also saying that some people saying that they cannot read the text the text that they see in the in the videos
00:27:01 [W] You know integrated in the slides those videos were mostly for giving you a feeling of what what the ui's worry about and not really like to give you a complete tour of the tools.
00:27:08 [W] Of course.
00:27:09 [W] I hope that makes sense regardless, we will try to share the slides and maybe maybe in another immediate will be a bit clearer, but that was the idea.
00:27:27 [W] Another mutant.
00:27:30 [W] Yes now.
00:27:31 [W] I'm unmuted I think okay. There are many tips around what to explore so definitely need to check out a lot of more tools.
00:27:40 [W] So I think there is yeah the landscape is definitely growing so I can read all of them.
00:27:45 [W] What is most used feature of such you is that that's a very good question actually, so maybe we can answer this depending on our personal experience some my most used feature actually.
00:27:57 [W] Lee is filtering for example by bipods failing across multiple clusters or searching for an application across multiple clusters in the land where funded 70 cluster, so I kind of need to quickly jump to something and also
00:28:12 [W] Instead of going to another tool to look at application lock. So this is more the troubleshooting use case Joachim. You probably also have some most feature.
00:28:14 [W] Use feature.
00:28:16 [W] I don't manage those those many clusters like you do. I think I think the future I use is also filtering but mostly filtering like / searching so
00:28:31 [W] Right part, for example, if I know what I'm looking into then I just like to type and go straight to it.
00:28:28 [W] Okay.
00:28:29 [W] Yeah trying to look through.
00:28:36 [W] Yeah, there are some questions about this slide.
00:28:39 [W] So I think the slides will be online. Anyway from from on Cube Khan.
00:28:47 [W] Where's the UI not ideal way to interact with multi cluster case this one?
00:28:52 [W] I don't fully understand so I would say most of you guys I'm really do multiples.
00:29:03 [W] Okay, sing a are just like oh, hello.
00:29:07 [W] hope they will be sorry heading.
00:29:12 [W] Are any of the two is better at searching within put logs?
00:29:16 [W] Yeah, I don't really know.
00:29:19 [W] I haven't tried all of them to specifically for that use case.
00:29:22 [W] I know my own tool is very basic.
00:29:24 [W] It can just search for a simple string. So nothing nothing fancy or came that you did you look into how the pot locks filtering works for all the different tools.
00:29:41 [W] No, I don't think I don't think I got further than you in that way.
00:29:45 [W] I hope there will be sorry Annie.
00:29:45 [W] Are any of the two is better at searching within put logs?
00:29:49 [W] Yeah, I don't really know.
00:29:52 [W] I haven't tried all of them to specifically for that use case.
00:29:56 [W] I know my own tool is very basic. It can just search for a simple string. So nothing nothing fancy your came that you did you look into how the pot locks filtering works for all the different tools.
00:30:14 [W] No, I don't think I don't think I got further than you in that way.
00:30:22 [W] Because it started talking about about filtering right?
00:30:26 [W] Yeah, I don't think so.
00:30:29 [W] I don't think we got the far but it's a good question.
00:30:35 [W] Any recommendations for our bargain a will clusters?
00:30:39 [W] For example AKs are were constant pain for my users getting stalkers for a decade as brows. I guess most clusters are nowadays and they will with our work.
00:30:51 [W] I mean I work is ended by default.
00:30:53 [W] So I'm not fully sure what this question is about happy to follow up on on slack.
00:30:59 [W] Definitely.
00:31:00 [W] I know that some tools also had lamp right you mentioned it is a
