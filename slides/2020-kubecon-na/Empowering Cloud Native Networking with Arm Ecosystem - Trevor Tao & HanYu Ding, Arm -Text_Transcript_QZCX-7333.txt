00:00:00 [W] Hello, everyone.
00:00:01 [W] Good afternoon.
00:00:04 [W] Today, my topic is empowering canonical networking with arm ecosystem.
00:00:09 [W] to start this
00:00:11 [W] Sachin
00:00:13 [W] thank you.
00:00:19 [W] Firstly I've liked you give out the agenda for the day and then firstly its introduction a brief introduction for our today's topic and the second one would be reference Cloud native networking stack on the third one
00:00:34 [W] So do I want her to be high performance containerd network interfaces for canonical networking on and the first one will repeat a Marty interface you comment. This is our we support
00:00:37 [W] Would I be with the like to give out some performs test results for various containerd wrinkled face his own arm and they 612 the be six item would be canonical networking use cases and deployment arm.
00:00:53 [W] Outlast the one with the be our future work
00:00:56 [W] firstly I would like to talk about what is canonical networking.
00:01:01 [W] Currently to Computing means to use containerized open source software stack where each part of the app is packed into its own container then a mclee orchestrated. So that each party is actively scheduled and managed to optimize resource utilization.
00:01:17 [W] Now native networking is an approach to provide the networking environment for building and running applications that exploit the advantages of cloud computing delivery model. So high performance flexible and a function reach
00:01:32 [W] Acknowledge is the key to the success of canal native computing.
00:01:35 [W] for various cni-genie
00:02:05 [W] He's armed originally joined.
00:02:09 [W] Its anynines foundation ten years ago and a joiner cncf as a good remembering February 2019 and upgraded to a platinum member 19 the member on November 20 19 and is already a key player
00:02:24 [W] Centric organization such as Telco Telecom infrared project-- he BDK final and Nina's foundations occurring on Project.
00:02:24 [W] And the arm provided the amnio worst a foundation for the 5 G Cloud 2 H infrastructure, and the arm is actively engaged with the cloud native software ecosystem to deliver optimized
00:02:39 [W] So devolve stings can afford and run codes and applications on arm-based Solutions.
00:02:39 [W] I'm provide a new words platform to support the cloud to Edge Cloud to Edge Computing.
00:02:47 [W] For example, the arm Jake currently the arm on one platform provide a very high performance scale high performance.
00:02:58 [W] high performance support for the
00:03:02 [W] Claude 2H Computing and it's a for the next generation and the provide an on one platform provide 60% performance uplift from
00:03:17 [W] 72 I'm cause and there's for the next iteration for twenty Twenty-One X Direction and kubeflow Lon.
00:03:21 [W] named it as pursues her Sears and informants beasts a semiconductor technology from 770 meat Q 5 nanometer.
00:03:34 [W] And therefore there are many overs and to cap phone. We provided to get Canal to Edge efficiencies for the cloud. They descend errs. We pride certitude you 192 cores, which has a very high rather high performance,
00:03:49 [W] Hi Qualcomm high power consumption or Cloud CPUs.
00:03:45 [W] For the middle middle call for the middle call for the ayat. You see case and the faculty use cases.
00:03:52 [W] We provide the middle called count with care of Q City six cars and the Visa. Median PDP median power consumption pounds compulsion for the
00:04:07 [W] Six cars and the Visa median he d p median power consumption hounds compulsion for the Fire Chi and to Edge and something like switches and a small Nick CPUs for the no
00:04:13 [W] Switches and it's my mix CPUs for the no end.
00:04:18 [W] No and adds devices 405 G or other Edge devices.
00:04:23 [W] We provide very low call count low power kit for the Gateway and the routes if you use so it's and series platform scalability scale. We use the performance requirements for each use cases.
00:04:40 [W] And actually cloudbees clouds deserve that cated cause for the hyper-threading one the data center and press read performance will win the cloud with more and more more and more
00:04:55 [W] Roof educated cause for the hyper-threading one the data center and press read performance will win the cloud with more and more more and more High problems cross-type hormones called high performance threads.
00:05:15 [W] Skype hormones call have problems with rats. Now. I'm had the in lab. I'm enabling a friction is cloudevents pins from various open source, propun source software projects.
00:05:30 [W] as from the workloads such as say
00:05:36 [W] now with actual give it a sir. Once it apart is a reference cloudevents working stackrox arm in this reference clown native networking stack.
00:05:46 [W] If I believe to give I leave the use the hardware acceleration from Smart Nick or integrated accelerators with semantics and from there.
00:05:59 [W] We will use the operating system now, we will provide a real-time knickknacks distribution.
00:06:05 [W] Attorneys and the SR we and activity case support from the oxidation layer from the orchestration layer.
00:06:12 [W] We will provide the kubernative x Ox changing for the containers and containerized installers and the restore clear and other things like that for under networking until software.
00:06:24 [W] We would provide we PPO vs and demeaning cistern and working with the epp epp support and for the containerd working.
00:06:34 [W] they flannel catechol zebrium this.e B PF and continue vpv still BDK support and ovhcloud is always support will also be provided and as the high level we would provide a kubernative so networking
00:06:49 [W] I don't know the battens policy have a little bitty t&s left tackle external IBS and the Securities and for all the service provided for the be like something like cncf servicemeshcon elements ci/cd and others
00:07:03 [W] SEF servicemeshcon the ci/cd and others you would like to support the 5G Network functions Mac and other web-based the microservices.
00:06:55 [W] So if the like to talk about the core of this Cloud native networking stack is to support Network Technologies for there to be able to use Linux is another driver bridgecrew pdk, which is
00:07:10 [W] That and if layers three the would have beat Abby tables and four layers read also be overlay tunnel for a VIP VX line and Vai and other I beat a nose other an IP based on the tunnels.
00:07:26 [W] Well are two and three for the Intel two three.
00:07:32 [W] Technology is the most important value will be the colonel git which is e PF e PF but could impact the filter enhanced each provide programs Maps registers helper functions or things like that. You support the
00:07:48 [W] These oriented those supporter in the kernel and therefore on the layout 7.
00:07:50 [W] We would apply the HTTP proxy for the envoy based on y based HTTP proxy and there's this is the reference Cloud native networking stack provided provided on arm.
00:08:07 [W] Now with the like to we would like to talk something about the high-performance containerd working interfaces for the containerd networking allow the native networking on arm.
00:08:21 [W] actually, it's a high-performance containerd a winter base is available for arm is a there is a lot of a lot of support for the type of instruction containerd work interfaces on arm and we would like to kill we would like to
00:08:37 [W] give you a brief conduction from the our icy reference stackrox IC reference which is from Ocarina is appropriate which is provided in the integrated into icy repo.
00:08:49 [W] And all were late that it will collect traction and was easy easy deployment.
00:08:49 [W] And the second one will be easy.
00:08:52 [W] You will be Syrian, which is a very popular networking support containerd of green supported a which uses anynines EPF based on network policy though the balance and the security which is believed to be this incredible performance and
00:09:07 [W] Beating host busy good scalability to and the cloud continually P which uses vital if you to provide the night work collectively between ports and the rich uses knative D BT K interface support for fiscal Nick.
00:09:22 [W] to do
00:09:17 [W] We'll all be on kubernetes it is oh, yes, ovhcloud Schuller basic kubernative networking solution rather good performance of is obvious inherited and you see Soviet nautical switches and routers to collect parts of outside access.
00:09:33 [W] For the mark for the SRV physical interface support.
00:09:37 [W] We provide Martyrs VCS. Are we seeing eyes which provided the right direct physical interfaces or PF bof support for port and which is hype for room service direct which direct Linux kernel is another driver
00:09:52 [W] A PMD driver and eat your chili cowork with all the Sig nice such as financial calculator by Marcus and other glue seeing eyes.
00:09:58 [W] And the last one with the betta widely used for Nano used which is a easy.
00:10:04 [W] the deployment for simple communities that working for which uses Linux standard bridgecrew for poor communication and overlay based communication for in host success.
00:10:15 [W] So if you are interested in all these signals, you could find them on you could have anything in the icy repo in our kirino?
00:10:26 [W] Here, I would like to give a brief give a brief introduction about the status of cni-genie arm platform and all contributing which is only a small very small part of it.
00:10:40 [W] Now I would like to talk something about a smart individual requirement without vnx Monica support on arm.
00:10:48 [W] Here is a multiple interfaces support by servicing. I usually we provide a legacy a legacy Fernando and canonical plugin for the all the ports as a default seeing eye
00:11:03 [W] Optionally the user wanted to use up high performs interfaces in the airport.
00:10:56 [W] So we provide the service in as a pelagic fishing I plug in to provide the second either to pry the second interfaces interface and the second interface would be the physical interface
00:11:11 [W] Sonique which is maybe a VF or VT R PF of a physical Nick here we provide this Sr. We support people we have support to the Pod with a small Nick which is from the
00:11:09 [W] Is your friend but come here is the right path provided some day. We Source configuration for the you Source configuration for the fiscal for the are we have
00:11:21 [W] Well, they say sorry interfaces from the broad come from this rock come fix my neck.
00:11:26 [W] We provided the drivers without BPM xte internet the driver and the we provided description about this driver and the about this thing's so the system will discover all the repay all the related
00:11:42 [W] But what your function interface is clear, and if we want to provide the DVD Kata Vice drivers, we would like to use the given degree drivers which give it a good drivers which we have our PSI Q is a physical is a physical Nick by Intel.
00:11:55 [W] Elias which we have our piece of IQ.
00:11:53 [W] These are physical is a physical neck by Intel.
00:11:57 [W] Here is another way of attachment the definition for the resource as are we not we wish you the be used in a product description and provide the IP am support.
00:12:11 [W] is a for the IP address or location for the prod.
00:12:14 [W] For example, if we want to provide a sry, sry, sry interface into a pot in besides original Lexi Lexi flannel calcul interface.
00:12:29 [W] We provide to provide a descriptive notation here for the SRV net1 and the re provide the resource requests here for on bol.com. PS22 here is 20 to 25
00:12:44 [W] Lexi Lexi Fernando Ocala coil interface you provide to provide a description and annotations here for the S. Are we at one and the re provided the resource requests here
00:13:17 [W] I said one each one and one resource. So it will provide the j1s. Are we interface into the Pod is this is this is this part here is the
00:13:33 [W] containers in a single host the fire service in guy and the repo divider take a sari Singh a by smart people PS2 25 with a single PDF but of these two different VF and it is collected by
00:13:48 [W] For it to be half squatting as the in a single host for the Intel host communication with other hosts.
00:13:54 [W] We also could use the sorry singer plug-in which will provide a we have support we have support to the outside world.
00:14:04 [W] say SRV interface for the second host you here you can see this part can communicate with another host. We say sorry interface VZ M P9 s the result.
00:14:16 [W] Choose the smart snyk through the semantic VF 0 and to the outside work with outside host.
00:14:28 [W] So we had it we had it down some performance tests for the various continuously interfaces on arm platform.
00:14:37 [W] And the first one would be clear. We provided the conformance tests or different signals with different back-end pick and support. For example, we had tested categories IP IP tunnel and categories
00:14:52 [W] And a phenomenal is IP IP tunnel Fernando Rees.
00:14:55 [W] Oh, yeah cleanse Hollow, excellent.
00:14:57 [W] Hallo and the City of is excellent panel. For example, we can say we get the results as follows two initial Buzz Ovation for the TCP for Farmers over different singers.
00:15:11 [W] We got is for example, we get to know the performance gap between cni-genie also explicit bring over later.
00:15:20 [W] no is used and
00:15:21 [W] Kylie coredns tufin a no-show little bit bad performance then city of the most epic use here and there is IP IP to make slang overnight tunnel import enabled as a large empty side just to put the performance is better and
00:15:36 [W] Thomas he's an artistically frequently affected by material size.
00:15:27 [W] Here as the time is limited where I would locked I would a lot talk too much about the results.
00:15:34 [W] You're going to check the date. Check it check then detailed check the details by yourself in the latest in this slide lately.
00:15:45 [W] And they're very interesting result here is that if we had um some HTTP performance benchmarking for saying so nice with various back ends here is the HDTV to host the to service HDD performance, which is
00:16:00 [W] Before openebs what different from different thing ice can shake a bit collection by the bees and line chikipede performance result with the increase of the threads. We used in the approve test.
00:16:08 [W] Here, I would like to say something about the servicemeshcon arm.
00:16:12 [W] So we smash so we smash is the communication layer in Microsoft Stack Up setup or requests to and from each other services goes through the mesh. Also long lasting for chocolate layer in a micro service set up the servicemeshcon.
00:16:37 [W] and then kind of meat rechecks pirate for service communication policies configuration Gallery control plan computer configuration and SC title so that Dow security and credential management and
00:16:52 [W] All requests to and from each other services goes through the mesh also long lasting for chocolate layer in a Microsoft set up the servicemeshcon.
00:17:15 [W] pedal so that Owl security and credential management and the from the data problem is on Y, which has the HTTP proxy for the high problems proxy developed in C++ and the
00:17:31 [W] Envoy Envoy provide a lot of services such as service tickets Discovery such as rate limit such as rate limit.
00:17:43 [W] And for the L7 field L7 field and the other ones to the load balancing on all things like set and the re provided a sto use cases for the
00:18:12 [W] Amy's on why which has the HTTP proxy for the high-performance proxy developed in C++ and the
00:18:22 [W] Envoy armor, I provide a lot of services such as service tickets Discovery such as rate limit such as rate limit.
00:18:34 [W] And for the L7 field L7 field and the other ones to do the balancing on all things like set.
00:18:44 [W] And the re provided I sto use cases for the ecop looking for example on arm.
00:18:51 [W] We did we had deployed as this is to example example on armed with on platform with the product page read page reviews on the ports and on why you work here works either set card to
00:19:43 [W] All armed with we had to deploy this is to example an example on arm disarm platform with the product page read page reviews on the ports and on why you work here works either
00:20:14 [W] You supported a microservices architecture for the access data flow for the different accessories.
00:20:23 [W] Now how you doing from China? Mobile would talk something about all the talk something about the use case which in China mobile provided for the arm platform.
00:20:49 [W] As we all know the cloud native technical will promote 5j services in China mobile to be more flexible and convenient the virtual machine-based orchestration as transparent transformed into
00:21:04 [W] And the component based orchestration, the gradual gradual precipitation of operator capabilities will will further enhance business creativity and flexible.
00:21:18 [W] in recent years China mobile has actively invested in the open source field of edge Computing and China mobile has been elected to the Akron Ohio Community Technical committee
00:21:32 [W] And have actively lead many at Claude blueprint projects in Akron OH.
00:21:40 [W] So I will introduce the some use Trace inch and a mobile to mobile and its Partners through into the initialed and to be the PTL at the to at renewal projects
00:21:55 [W] Which have successfully released the are 3 version of the community.
00:21:58 [W] The first is a about the cloud Android Cloud and knative with apple applications server in h and this project mainly provide the end-to-end Android
00:22:13 [W] Around Android Cloud trimming scenarios. The cloud gaming is one of the create a vertical industrial applications of 5j H Computing
00:22:24 [W] Bail at mainly deploys cloud game rendering and editing in at add node and some decoding storage some other.
00:22:35 [W] functions the project we are provided Android Cloud own native running environment under the architecture for mobile terminal of the Christians at the age and
00:22:48 [W] Will reduce the difficulty of deployment and the development of applications on the cloud and the reduce the deployment cost of Android at Claude.
00:23:01 [W] next
00:23:03 [W] the setting the project
00:23:07 [W] it's a about.
00:23:10 [W] the smart knative
00:23:13 [W] the R3 R3 version of the integrated ovhcloud Tab 5 blue point released for the first time the OAS of load reference implementation of the
00:23:29 [W] The network and card based on the soc after temperature and it also merged into the aquarium node. Community are 3 version and the first release of the
00:23:40 [W] It's based on the soc architecture. And OBS dp/dt is a loaded to the smart network card, which can enhance the support performance of each network with a PC.
00:23:41 [W] is the patch the loss right and enhance the management of network card resources to save more Computing resources in the future and the performance of 5 3 U PF Network in
00:23:54 [W] Deployed in the ash cloud data center in China mobile can also be enhanced by realizing the installation function of network card.
00:24:04 [W] So now mobile as welding to further promote the maturity business innovation of the cloud native Computing through the active exploration and
00:24:19 [W] The field of cloth and knative and as Computing open source, and the way our welding to treat a win-win Cloud native Computing enclosed system.
00:24:32 [W] Okay, anything I suppose the enhancement on and platform and the rule for example for ci/cd performs a future comparisons and it would like to give some performance optimization of over a ton of communication on
00:24:44 [W] Deployments about a clown knative narrowing our amp level. For example a Are We R 5G Mac and servicemeshcon Croatian with high-performance singers such as Syrian proxy and a father typically Incorporated containing a living using the model and a performance evaluation
00:24:56 [W] Ethel hypothalamus Connecticut Solutions arm is up to date processes.
00:24:59 [W] Here is some references used in today's topic use this in today's topic and the thank you all for today for attending this meeting.
00:25:11 [W] Bye-bye.
