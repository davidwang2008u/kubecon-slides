00:00:00 [W] When Mark and dressen wrote has Wall Street Journal article in August 2011 in which this famous quote software is eating the world appears.
00:00:30 [W] When Mark and Reston wrote has Wall Street Journal article in August 2011 in which this famous quote software is eating the world appears.
00:00:44 [W] He was really addressing the question of software disrupting every single vertical whether through digital transformation of incumbents or through.
00:01:06 [W] Of software disrupting every single vertical whether through digital transformation of incumbents or through new startups
00:01:22 [W] That would show up in the markets and create new opportunities there.
00:01:30 [W] What Mark and dressing wasn't expecting though was how ubiquitous open source would be in the course of a decade if we look at the numbers in 2018 those numbers come
00:01:46 [W] What Mark and dressing wasn't expecting though was how ubiquitous open source would be in the course of a decade if we look at the numbers in 2018 those numbers come
00:02:22 [W] Black duck a company that does merger and Acquisitions audit about a thousand to twelve hundred each year in 2018 96% of the applications that they surveyed
00:02:37 [W] ninety-six percent of the applications that they surveyed contained open source components in in those
00:02:46 [W] open source was actually counted for over half of the code base.
00:02:52 [W] so with that was that in mind, I think it's time that we revisit marking dressen's decade-old statement and transform it to say that in short open source
00:03:08 [W] Time that we revisit my can dressen's decade-old statement and transform it to say that in short open source is eating the world.
00:03:25 [W] So although pretty much everyone that is building software now is using and relying on open source for a substantial amount of the software that they're building.
00:03:39 [W] It turns out that still very few companies actually contribute back to open source.
00:03:49 [W] And you know this begs the question well, why should companies contribute to open source in the first place?
00:03:55 [W] Why would they do that?
00:03:56 [W] What's in it for them to some degree?
00:03:58 [W] And the answers we have to this questions usually are very much.
00:04:07 [W] Kumbaya answers for lack of a better word essentially we will talking about well, you should contribute back because it's for the common good or it's paying it forward or it's the right thing to do etcetera Etc,
00:04:23 [W] None of these reasons are really addressing genuine business-driven reasons for company to contribute to open source.
00:04:31 [W] And the problem was addressing open source contributing to open source. That way is that when you put these lightweight feeling good reasons on the
00:04:46 [W] on the you start comparing them was counter arguments that will arise from other parts of your organization such as losing IP or losing a competitive advantage or increasing your risk surface,
00:04:57 [W] Listing of resources on the open source that can ultimately just help other companies or just the fact that as a as a company. You don't really have the know-how of how to contribute to how to release open source, then this makes it really difficult.
00:05:09 [W] To concretely solidly make the business case for open source inside of your company.
00:05:13 [W] And so the purpose of this presentation today is essentially to move a place where as an industry.
00:05:21 [W] We understand the return on investment that the ri of using open source really? Well, the proof of that is that everyone is actually using open source and doing
00:05:36 [W] And doing what realizing first of all that. We don't really understand the value of contributing to open source that well and giving us a number of tools there toolbox essentially to
00:05:49 [W] And giving us a number of tools a toolbox essentially to be able to assess the actual benefits contributing to open source would have for our organization and be able to argument that and present
00:06:04 [W] Well to argument that and present a strong business case for doing so.
00:06:11 [W] The other aspect obviously is that the risk of contributing to open source are not really well understood like the the shark here. We are concerned.
00:06:24 [W] scared of sharks when in fact, they're essentially not really dangerous animals and they don't kill they kill way less people than bees or even dogs do on a daily basis. And so
00:06:39 [W] Our fear of contributing to open source as based on unmanned not well understood risk and exaggerated risk.
00:06:52 [W] So let's start with trying to understand the value of contributing to open source. And for this we'll look at three categories of benefits of Open Source strategic benefits operational benefits and what I like to call second-order benefits
00:07:08 [W] Dorothy was strategic benefits.
00:07:14 [W] One of the key Strategic Benefit of Open Source that is used by companies as using it to commoditize your compliment.
00:07:24 [W] Well, what's the compliment to a business?
00:07:27 [W] It's the thing that needs to exist so that you can sell the products that you are building.
00:07:36 [W] So let's have a look at some concrete examples and how that translates into open source projects and open-source involvement in in contributing to projects.
00:07:48 [W] Google for example, well, they're key Focus their core focus of their business obviously is search and what's the compliment to search while it's a way to bring eyeballs and people to search
00:08:04 [W] And won't turns out that unsurprisingly Google is heavily invested into open source projects that do just at the Android platform and chromium, which is behind the Chrome browser.
00:08:08 [W] Let's look at Intel.
00:08:10 [W] What's what is Intel's Core Business.
00:08:13 [W] Well Intel builds and sells chips.
00:08:18 [W] What's the complement to a chip? What an operating system obviously and hence unsurprisingly. It turns out that Intel is the biggest contributor to link to Linux.
00:08:30 [W] Talking of Linux Red Hat the second biggest country boot to Linux essentially builds services and packaging around Lennox enhance contributes to it.
00:08:46 [W] Facebook that's a really interesting example because it stretches this idea of Kuma ties in your compliment a bit and lets us see how open source can benefit us in very unexpected ways.
00:09:02 [W] You can say that Facebook's Core Business is actually data mining of user behaviors and and and finding patterns that they can then sell to advertisers to do targeted advertisement.
00:09:09 [W] And so if you think that data mining is their key Focus then obviously the compliment to data mining is all of the hardware that you need to have to build the data centers that
00:09:11 [W] For stocking and processing all of them user information and so a number of years ago Facebook started the open compute project which which is essentially open sourcing data.
00:09:23 [W] Center plans and server and Hardware specifications and as a result of this Facebook mentioned on numerous occasions that it had and was able to save
00:09:37 [W] Of dollars by creating a Level Playing Field for the hardware manufacturers and being able to really just pick from the vendors that were the most interesting to them that we're all building to their specs.
00:09:50 [W] And other very common strategy used for open source is to on-ramp developers on to paid offerings.
00:10:02 [W] So it's a surprise to no one in 2020 that developers are actually critical in the purchasing decisions of organizations.
00:10:12 [W] Because once it developer knows that technology prototypes in your product on that technology, it is fairly
00:10:19 [W] Carmen for that technology to end up in production and thus was sort of like Enterprise level service agreements after that and so unsurprisingly Cloud providers and
00:10:35 [W] Sort of infrastructure providers have are focusing on open source significantly to bring developers to their offerings.
00:10:46 [W] It's explains.
00:10:47 [W] For example, why Microsoft but get hub for seven and a half billion is a couple of years ago in order to really Drive usage of it's a zero platform now, we've looked at strategic.
00:11:02 [W] If it's let's look at operational benefits.
00:11:05 [W] So those are interesting because there are actually useful to companies that are not necessarily buying sorry selling software directly a key one obviously
00:11:20 [W] Technical depth, I think we've all been there used as an open source project forked it to fix a bunch of things that were specific to our needs and then had to handle sort of
00:11:24 [W] Pulling new versions and ended up was a lot of work in that space and sometimes as a result not patching for security issues fast enough, etcetera.
00:11:30 [W] Well, those are really easy solution to that problem just Upstream your changes right contribute back your changes to the community and suddenly this kind of like technical cost just essentially
00:11:45 [W] another really interesting benefit of contributing to open source is to leverage the external contributions a great example is we act when Facebook released react they
00:12:00 [W] Bunch of white papers for sort of like other pieces of the ecosystem that would be a useful to react applications and knowing behold the community actually wrote things like react
00:12:12 [W] Lo and behold the community actually wrote things like react router and verdicts based on those white papers and really quickly the teams at Facebook that were relying on that we using react and had built internal equivalents to
00:12:24 [W] Evelyn's to react router and redox realized how bad are these external tools where and use them instead and the other interesting benefit here is that they were also able to hire
00:12:39 [W] To these projects so the last category of benefits of contributing to open source. I'd like to look at our second order benefits.
00:12:49 [W] And to better understand what those are let's store. It was this diagram this diagram describes the process of engineering and it shows an engineer that takes as input a problem in
00:13:04 [W] And that spits out as output a solution and as byproducts on Chasm.
00:13:12 [W] If you change that slightly in consider the same process diagram for software engineer and nothing much changes, except the output instead of being just a random solution is now expressed in code.
00:13:26 [W] Turn the same software engineer and to an engineer that is contributing to open source code and what you will see as that this output this code
00:13:41 [W] Turn the same software engineer into an engineer that is contributing to open source code and what you will see as that this output this code
00:14:03 [W] Now feeding upon the pool of comments.
00:14:09 [W] And shortly thereafter what happens another software engineer comes to contribute to the same pool.
00:14:17 [W] And what's really interesting is that this other engineer can come from a completely different background whether it is cultural or it could be a corporate engineer or instead a student
00:14:32 [W] Asked just enjoying this particular project and soon these two software Engineers will start interacting.
00:14:43 [W] This could be just through random conversations on a mailing list or GitHub issue.
00:14:50 [W] It could be in code reviews.
00:14:52 [W] It could be through mentoring.
00:14:54 [W] It could be through networking events and in real life or online Etc. Now remember the sarcasm is a byproduct that I was mentioning earlier.
00:15:07 [W] That's they are more the joke turns out that by products are really interesting and obviously all of this conversation could refuse mentoring etcetera going on.
00:15:20 [W] Also creates byproducts and when you think about those they are the key to the second-order benefits of Open Source.
00:15:30 [W] Let's have a look at a few.
00:15:36 [W] As you can see from those there are a lot of byproducts of having people work together on open source code.
00:15:45 [W] It's hard to figure out exactly what the benefits are here.
00:15:49 [W] So let's organize them and four categories that essentially are benefits to projects individuals teams and organizations.
00:15:59 [W] as you can see benefits to project will really be focused on how how the code and it's documentation is improved as a result and of being an open source project
00:16:11 [W] Individuals, it's really about leveling up engineers and having them build the kind of skills.
00:16:06 [W] That will make them better leaders and will also give them more opportunities.
00:16:14 [W] As a team teams that participate in open source get to meet other teams that do the same and this obviously feeds efficiencies and Innovation and finally at an
00:16:29 [W] Aviation and finally at an organizational level companies that contribute to open source tend to see as a result improve culture and more on being perceived as Leaders access to a talent pool that it would not have access to otherwise
00:16:41 [W] Milk friendly, which again in 2020 is a really nice byproduct and reducing things like churn.
00:16:49 [W] All right. So by looking at all of these new benefits of Open Source, we're now sort of tilting the scales back in favor of contributing but are doing this was solid arguments.
00:17:04 [W] So the other thing that we have to do now to really continue completely tilting the scales in and showing the benefits of Open Source is to actually assess the the negative aspects.
00:17:20 [W] That people mention when we talk about contributing to open source and wonder whether there are actually really that concerning so one of the key things that shows up all the time is.
00:17:35 [W] Going to open source means losing your competitive Advantage.
00:17:36 [W] So two things your first of all obviously, no one is suggesting that you should contribute the code.
00:17:43 [W] that is absolutely critical to your business and that you see as a huge competitive Advantage frankly. If you look at all the software stack in an organization, that's usually a really small chunk.
00:17:57 [W] It's not the whole thing.
00:17:58 [W] So start by contributing code that isn't key to running your business.
00:18:03 [W] and go from there the second aspect which I find really compelling and sorry to use this over used when Wayne Gretzky quote which says I skate to where the puck is going to be not too worried has been
00:18:18 [W] By contributing code that isn't key to running your business and go from there the second aspect which I find really compelling and sorta to use this over used when Wayne Gretzky quote, which says I skate to where the puck
00:18:42 [W] It turns out that if you want to be effective at competing against other companies just copying them is really a bad strategy like it doesn't work.
00:18:53 [W] You're always late.
00:18:53 [W] You're always a couple of years late and that's not how you win.
00:18:58 [W] So the real concern of like I'm going to build all of this software and other companies are just going to come and steal it and then beat us at our own game as
00:19:12 [W] wildly exaggerated
00:19:15 [W] Another one another problem that shows up early often is lost IP if we contribute to open source, we're going to lose IP and here the question is really one of what's the value of Ip compared to the value of having a great
00:19:31 [W] If teams that are able to iterate quickly and ship software, which is what you get when you have amazing teams of Engineers that are able to contribute to open source and that I happy to do so.
00:19:44 [W] so I'd like to quote young look out here who was the head of Facebook's machine learning AI Division and he says the following in today's world the fast-paced internet services deployment owning
00:19:59 [W] Come considerably less important than turning research results into Innovative products as quickly as possible and deploying them at scale.
00:20:04 [W] what matters is shipping Innovative products so build the teams that help you do that and one of the best way to build teams that help you do that is to have a really strong
00:20:19 [W] Company. All right. So there are a bunch of other risks of other issues like increased risk wasted resources lack of know-how etcetera that are also interesting to tackle.
00:20:25 [W] We don't really have the time today, but I just want to mention that most of those are either exaggerated again or can be handled like lack of know-how.
00:20:37 [W] It's easy to educate hire the right people to help buildpacks.
00:20:43 [W] Well that internal culture.
00:20:46 [W] alright, so a having done this we're really tilting now the scales in favor of contributing to open source, but of course what you have to remember is like that's going to be different for every
00:21:01 [W] And so what I wanted to do here today is give you the tools to be able to do this and to be able to do this for your specific context and your specific organization.
00:21:12 [W] So the key here is this is a framework to think in terms of business trade-offs, right?
00:21:12 [W] What's the benefit?
00:21:14 [W] What's a risk and understanding that in some cases risks can overweight benefits, but in general that is not the case.
00:21:25 [W] The second thing is this is actually a tool kit, right there are benefits and there are mitigation strategies and you should use those and apply those
00:21:35 [W] your organization
00:21:38 [W] So when you do that a few suggestions, first of all be reasonable if your company just invested heavily in a patent portfolio.
00:21:48 [W] It's going to be really difficult to make the case for giving all of that away, right?
00:21:54 [W] Second thing is show empathy to others needs any organization understand why legal is pushing back understand what it is that they need listen to them. It's very
00:22:07 [W] From the case that there were communication issues that prevent different organizations within a company of finding common ground and being able to move forward. So listen to others aim for small wins start small
00:22:22 [W] a final contributing back to a project that is not critical or releasing a small piece of software or organizing an event or giving money sponsoring some of them the dependencies that are critical to
00:22:36 [W] Or open Collective or something like that right start small and the key is to remember that this is a mindset shift right move from the notion that open source is good and that you should contribute to it because that's the
00:22:48 [W] Right to the notion of seeing how open source contribution is aligned with your business the business goals of your organization and can help drive them.
00:22:59 [W] You will find that conversations. Once you adopt this mindset. This mindset conversations was Executives in Business Leaders and legal are going to be way more easier because you suddenly speaking the same language.
00:23:14 [W] Conversations with Executives in Business Leaders and legal are going to be way more easier because you suddenly speaking the same language.
00:23:43 [W] Well yet.
00:23:46 [W] Yeah, I imagine so, all right, so well, thank you for staying in full of sitting to my presentation.
00:23:55 [W] I'm so I'm now going to go through some of the questions. I've received the here and I'll check also if like things are happening in slack at the same time.
00:24:04 [W] I'm seeing some comments and slack. So the first question that I have seen here is
00:24:16 [W] Should organizations have dedicated open source contributors or should they encourage every developer to contribute some open source. So that's a great question to me having a dedicated team that focuses on
00:24:32 [W] Everyone else ignores. It is a really strong anti pattern.
00:24:36 [W] This is the same kind of anti pattern that is often seen then sort of like older Industries when you have large organizations that really having a hard time adapting to changes in the system.
00:24:51 [W] um older Industries when you have large organizations that really having a hard time adapting to changes in the system and they often will end up creating like an innovation lab something like this and basically what
00:25:03 [W] From the will end up creating like an innovation lab with something like this and basically what it means is essentially checking a box right?
00:25:11 [W] It's like, yep.
00:25:12 [W] I'm handling open source, or I'm handling Innovation.
00:25:16 [W] See I have an innovation lab.
00:25:17 [W] I have an open source team and in practice.
00:25:20 [W] This really doesn't give you the benefit that you would want at a really building a strong open-source culture inside of your company. So in general, yeah, I'm really old for
00:25:33 [W] sighing, you know building a strong culture of Open Source that permeates the whole of your engineering company and Beyond it's great if like in, you know designed for example, a product starts to think about what open source means also from a strategic perspective and
00:25:48 [W] Business and legal. So I'll know my recommendation really build that as a culture that it's for all not for like a dedicated team of elite open source engineers and somewhere.
00:26:03 [W] Sorry for my voice.
00:25:53 [W] What am I seeing here?
00:25:58 [W] So one question asks does open source contribution also invite hackers to take advantage of systems.
00:26:06 [W] So in truth, there isn't really so there's sort of two theories around open source and security there is the linbit
00:26:20 [W] This 12l torvald famous quote of to if you have many eyeballs all bugs are shallow and practice like there isn't a lot of data that proves that open source software.
00:26:35 [W] Cured then I'll close or software.
00:26:36 [W] So frankly, the really isn't like there isn't an increased risk of using open source or contributing to open source as there is of using proprietary software obviously
00:26:52 [W] You see an increase in your usage of software and it's dependencies mean essentially the more software you use the bigger. The risks are right.
00:26:54 [W] And so we've seen you know over the last couple of maybe two three four years really a strong Push by the industry to improve the security of Open Source software, and I think that this is paying
00:27:09 [W] And that we're moving towards an increasingly more secure ecosystem was just overall better man should be ready. So I really don't think that
00:27:19 [W] open source at this point Cause US problems in that space or at least clearly clearly not more at all than clothes were self-aware would
00:27:32 [W] what else am I seeing here?
00:27:38 [W] How do you feel about paid open source, meaning companies paying into projects that they consume so this is also I'm sorry. I'm going to drink a bit because
00:27:52 [W] My voice my voice is my voice is going away.
00:27:55 [W] So that question is also a really interesting question and ties into the question of sustainability of Open Source.
00:28:05 [W] And also the question of whether opens companies should really be investing in open source, or just essentially paying into it. I think that the solution to open source sustainability comes from a combination
00:28:20 [W] Of solutions not in it.
00:28:24 [W] There's no Silver Bullet.
00:28:25 [W] Maybe dependencies that they're relying on and cannot really have engineering resources to work on is also something that's interesting.
00:28:32 [W] That's Ed in general.
00:28:34 [W] The problem of a lot of open source project is not so much that they're lacking money.
00:28:41 [W] It's more often that they're lacking time and people to actually do the work. So before you start paying a project, I think what you really want to do.
00:28:53 [W] is go check was that project and figure out what their real need is and see if you can actually be much more impactful by may be contributing some documentation or helping them triage bugs or you know
00:29:08 [W] Things that really need help and that money doesn't necessarily solve that easily.
00:29:14 [W] mmm
00:29:20 [W] Looking through the issues with the questions right now that are coming in.
00:29:29 [W] How do you recommend to approach open source communities especially in some cases where they do not accept your contributions, but take a different direction that you would like. That's another great question.
00:29:41 [W] Thank you for asking it.
00:29:46 [W] I think the best way of approaching any kind of Open Source Community is was humility and and being respectful of the work and the effort that people have put in them project.
00:29:59 [W] They're essentially providing for the community for free approaching a community was humility.
00:30:06 [W] However doesn't mean tolerating abuse, so it's really two different things one.
00:30:13 [W] One is really having having a humble approach.
00:30:17 [W] So it's you know showing respect and the other one is also expecting the same kind of respect in return.
00:30:22 [W] And then I think usually when a when a project doesn't accept your contributions there often are really good reasons.
00:30:25 [W] One of the key reason that I'm seeing is actually maintaining so sorry when we contribute code.
00:30:33 [W] We don't necessarily realize that on top of the code that we contribute there is maintaining that code and you know, once someone merges yugabyte
00:30:42 [W] Upon request it somehow becomes their responsibility to maintain that new feature or that new ability of the software and make sure that it works. Well with a whole bunch of you know other features
00:30:57 [W] The on in the future.
00:30:59 [W] So essentially accepting a contribution from someone is accepting more work.
00:31:05 [W] So there are a number of ways that you know that you can help with this one is to make sure that the contribution you're doing is actually wanted by the project so,
00:31:21 [W] Before you actually open a pull request and work on something for hours file an issue and check wisdom.
00:31:26 [W] Say Hey, you know, I'm having this issue.
00:31:27 [W] I would like to solve this issue that way if I did would you be open to emerging that pull request?
00:31:34 [W] So, you know, that's a like asked the question before doing the work and then you know, if this is something really matters to you, maybe your employer and the the community of the project is not too
00:31:49 [W] It may be sort of like start building a relationship was the project and build trust so that they will be convinced that you will be able to maintain this in the long term.
00:32:02 [W] So I think we might have like one minute to answer real quick question.
00:32:07 [W] Yeah, so I think one of the things that I'm Chloe I'm going to be in slacks. If you have more questions I can I can answer those in written in a few minutes.
00:32:19 [W] Oh, that's a great question.
00:32:21 [W] Can you recommend us some book or resources to understand some must understood business models around open source.
00:32:27 [W] That's a great question. Like nothing comes up to my mind really quickly.
00:32:32 [W] I think it's a topic that you can start finding bit of information on the net about but on the web about but not like I don't have a comprehensive book to suggest.
00:32:43 [W] I maybe we can chat about this in slack if you want to join me.
00:32:49 [W] And I think I've addressed most of the questions that we're here.
00:32:54 [W] And I think we're at the end of our time.
00:32:57 [W] So, yeah, if you have more questions, if you want to talk about this more, please join me slack in the community Channel and I'll be happy to chat with you there.
00:33:08 [W] Thank you so much for your time.
00:33:09 [W] On slack the link to the slides into the video the recording.
00:33:10 [W] thank you so much folks.
00:33:12 [W] Have a great one and enjoy the rest of the conference.
