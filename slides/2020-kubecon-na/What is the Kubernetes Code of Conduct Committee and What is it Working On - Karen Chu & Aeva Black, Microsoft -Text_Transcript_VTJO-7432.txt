00:00:00 [W] Hi everybody and welcome to the kubernative code of conduct committee Community update 2020.
00:00:05 [W] Hi, my name is Ava black and I am the open source program manager for the confidential compute team at Azure.
00:00:13 [W] Everyone, I'm Karen shoe.
00:00:15 [W] I'm an open source Community p.m. On the container compute up treaty also at Microsoft Azure and my pronouns are she and her
00:00:24 [W] let's get started.
00:00:25 [W] Alright, so in today's session we're going to talk about the current state of the code of conduct committee including for our members are what our purpose is what our scope is and our plans and progress around documentation.
00:00:41 [W] Little bit of background about the committee and our organization and our relationship to steering.
00:00:27 [W] There are five members of the committee three in addition to Karen and I we also have Tasha and Tim at VMware and Celesta the cncf and the five of us are elected or appointed by steering but then given
00:00:42 [W] Ours, we don't actually report to steering one of the few committees that doesn't and this was intentional.
00:00:44 [W] Both of these committees are intentionally stackrox to hold each other accountable if that need ever were to arise also to note is that no more than two members of the code of conduct committee are ever from the same company and this
00:01:00 [W] rise also to note is that no more than two members of the code of conduct committee are ever from the same company and this avoids a perception of single party control it avoids any situation where a conflict of interest might arise
00:01:12 [W] Hold it avoids any situation where a conflict of interest might arise and if one were to arise members of this committee, do we do recuse ourselves from dealing with atoms?
00:01:23 [W] So there's enough of the committee still engaged in something even if let's say something happened involving one of the companies.
00:01:33 [W] Now our purpose as a committee is to provide and support and enforce a well-considered Viewpoint of what constitutes acceptable behavior within a community within our community and to do this we focus on a restorative model that believes in the inherent
00:01:48 [W] And of all members of the kubernetes community, and we also believe that codes of Conduct in general do not need to be punitive to be effective.
00:02:01 [W] Okay, so let's talk about the scope of the committee here.
00:02:05 [W] We've opted out some examples of environments that fall between official and unofficial spaces as well as online and offline spaces.
00:02:13 [W] The committee is invested in all these different quadrants because they made Volve community members and may affect book the health and behavior of the community if iot have some examples you want to share things counted love to so while the obvious
00:02:28 [W] the committee is invested in all these different quadrants because they may involve community members and may affect book the health and behavior of the community if iot have some examples you want to share things counted love to so while the obvious
00:02:49 [W] Online might be our GitHub and our slack or offline might be things like the Linux foundation events the kubernative zaku come like this. There are less obvious ones are podcasts and streams of people run or a personal Twitter for a Sig
00:03:04 [W] or a official Meetup or an unofficial meet up or even just a couple community members gathering together at a local coffee shop to hang out and talk about what's happening in their working group because all of these are
00:03:19 [W] Hang out and talk about what's happening in their working group because all of these are spaces filled by members of our community acting in kubernative is interest.
00:03:27 [W] We feel that this is part of what makes our space safe and welcoming for everybody and especially true for folks who are in a leadership position in the community. It's important that they reflect the values of the community and make it a safe and welcoming space for everybody.
00:03:44 [W] Alright next we'll talk about committee relationships.
00:03:47 [W] So depending on the environment. Sometimes we work in conjunction with other parties where the Nexus to communicating with all these groups when there's an incident or concern no matter where in the community it may have come from so we're often involved in routing
00:04:02 [W] Their information is needed and deciding what actions to take but we're often not on the front lines because all these bodies are empowered to act in their respective domains.
00:04:12 [W] So think of us as tier 2 support and let's dive a little deeper into each of these bodies with Sig contributor experience.
00:04:22 [W] We Loosely advise them on on what they have questions around like cultural aspects. So that's something we'll work with them on.
00:04:32 [W] What's Takin GitHub advence their the Frontline admins in their spaces?
00:04:37 [W] So not only do they have the jurisdiction over their spaces.
00:04:40 [W] They're also the ones to perform the administration of it and help keep it free from spammers and Drive by trolling but in rare cases, they will reach out to the code of conduct committee mostly in Gray areas or if there's a repeated issue and lastly.
00:04:56 [W] help keep it free from spammers and Drive by trollee, but in rare cases, they will reach out to the code of conduct committee mostly in Gray areas or if there's a repeated issue and lastly when in-person events are I think again the Linux
00:05:12 [W] In-person events are think again the Linux Foundation event team members are the Frontline admins for those spaces because they're legally responsible for then use for managing events staff hiring security Etc.
00:05:25 [W] Nonetheless, though. We are there for them to help provide backup and to provide support for the community during face-to-face events.
00:05:35 [W] So what we do to Foster an inclusive and welcoming environment as Karen mentioned, sometimes we support working groups, but we also support community members directly.
00:05:48 [W] So if you are leading a working group were involved in one and would like our input on something you're writing or doing or you want her working tufin watching our engagement early on please just reach out.
00:06:00 [W] out. But if you feel like an incident has happened and it's very subjective. Also, please do Reach Out
00:06:06 [W] What does that mean to say an incident happened?
00:06:09 [W] Well, if any series of interactions feels non-inclusive or combative or someone has an ill intent, you know, it's subjective.
00:06:21 [W] There isn't really a straight rubric for this.
00:06:23 [W] We're all human and historically we've found that the majority of Bad actors that we've seen were not actually part of our community. They just showed up like a troll on Twitter or a troll on GitHub to start trouble.
00:06:35 [W] Anyone in the community to distinguish between between the is if it feels unsafe to do so we've chosen to take on and accept the responsibility of doing that emotional work here to differentiate between a legitimate concern or grievance or folks that might be trying
00:06:50 [W] or if used and cause harm
00:06:50 [W] this space is very nuanced and I want to just reiterate that we know we're all human. We're all trying to do our best.
00:06:58 [W] And if non-inclusive Behavior seems to be happening.
00:07:02 [W] I'm going to talk you through a little bit of what our thought process is and how we respond to that.
00:07:06 [W] We ask ourselves some hard questions to try and understand the greater context and what people's intent was reformed coming to any conclusion or making any decision and I'll give two examples both happened on GitHub.
00:07:20 [W] The Karen's point to get her admins were the ones that handle these initially but both were gray enough that they came to our attention in the first example, a maintainer was perceived as sort of over aggressively closing issues and the contributor
00:07:35 [W] Eventually fired off some angry comments on GitHub and both of them Reach that the code of conduct committee to say.
00:07:41 [W] Hey, something's wrong with the person is being that we investigated.
00:07:45 [W] We talked to both people separately.
00:07:47 [W] We looked at the GitHub history has and realize that this wasn't an intentional harm the the automation had over aggressively close things.
00:07:56 [W] so the contributor in this case didn't realize that their issues were being closed not by a human but
00:08:04 [W] I bought and their anger was misplaced.
00:08:06 [W] Meanwhile, the maintainer realized that the automation tools they were using were closing more issues than they meant to and so they were able to modify the tools to better represent the intent. They wanted in the community and I'd say the outcome from this was pretty positive.
00:08:20 [W] Yes, and Feathers were ruffled in the beginning but both people are still members of the community and things improved.
00:08:28 [W] Now for a second example, this happened after someone just had just joined the community and began opening their first couple PRS because of the demographic that they represent they got targeted on GitHub and someone began posting harassing comments on their
00:08:43 [W] Take the outcome from this was pretty positive.
00:08:37 [W] Yes, and Feathers were ruffled in the beginning but both people are still members of the community and things improved.
00:08:44 [W] Now for a second example, this happened after someone just had just joined the community and began opening their first couple PRS because of the demographic that they represent they got targeted on GitHub and someone began posting harassing comments on their
00:09:12 [W] Um, and they were kind of ignoring it at first but then it kind of it continue to happen. This came to our attention and upon looking into this. We realize that the harassing comments were coming from someone who first of all wasn't a real wasn't a regular member
00:09:28 [W] First of all wasn't a real wasn't a regular member of our community, but they were harassing people of a demographic all over GitHub.
00:09:36 [W] They were just heard of a drive-by troll who happened to come into kubernative space and cause trouble here.
00:09:41 [W] so in that case we did reach out to the GitHub admin team and ask them to just block that person from our spaces entirely kind of a last resort, but it seemed prudent in that space in that incident to make our space safer for everyone.
00:09:58 [W] All right. So let's now discuss providing restorative support / community and focusing on harm reduction.
00:10:04 [W] So our intent is to safeguard and build trust in the community and all Communications with the code of conduct committee is confidential.
00:10:13 [W] This is a safe and private space when you come and talk to us and what exactly does that mean though. So with whichever means of communications you choose to utilize we never disclosed to one party what another party is said about a situation.
00:10:26 [W] and additionally we seek to verify reports without exposing the claimant while also avoiding potentially causing more emotional distress or Jeopardy for that matter timeliness is important to all of us so when you contact us
00:10:42 [W] Fight a response within a day and depending on the scenario we met which may reach out for more information.
00:10:48 [W] Just remember our goal is to find a path towards Community healing and individual growth and punishment is really Our Last Resort.
00:10:59 [W] And where can you go to reference all of this?
00:11:01 [W] So the committee is still fairly young we have a lot to do but we're committed to updating and Publishing documentation around our goals and standardized processes.
00:11:11 [W] We're hoping that by making our everything public and transparent the community will have clear expectations when it interacts with us.
00:11:19 [W] some of the docks that we're working on include how we receive reports and triage them how we handle work you cil's how we handle the logistics of
00:11:29 [W] Incident response educational materials that we can point the community to and we're hoping to publish transparency reports in the near future earlier as I mentioned.
00:11:40 [W] We also work oftentimes with other bodies that deal with code of conduct matters. So we're working on formalizing expectations and communication Channels with these groups this effort will also help Define our scope better.
00:11:57 [W] So where to find us if and when you need to reach us, you can e-mail conduct at kubernative cri-o to reach all of us at once.
00:12:05 [W] Community to and we're hoping to publish transparency reports in the near future earlier as I mentioned.
00:12:02 [W] We also work oftentimes with other bodies that deal with code of conduct matters. So we're working on formalizing expectations and communication Channels with these groups this effort will also help Define our scope better.
00:12:18 [W] So where to find us if and when you need to be chest, you can email conduct at kubernative cri-o to reach all of us at once. But if you do want to reach out to us individually, you can just DMS directly on the kubernative slack.
00:12:59 [W] Our job is to be here for the community.
00:13:01 [W] So as we mentioned you should get an additional response back within 24 hours of reaching out.
00:13:10 [W] now if you are a Sig lead or working group leader involved in those, like I said, by all means reach out you can get engaged with us directly and early on and if you
00:13:25 [W] To feel safe bringing their whole and authentic self here.
00:13:25 [W] So if you feel like something is off or something is wrong. Please reach out.
00:13:29 [W] Please know that also are our work happens mostly behind the scenes. So you may not really see it until we get get all of our processes matured enough to create transparency reports.
00:13:41 [W] You might not see what we're doing in the community unless you're in one of those six or working groups working with us, but know that we're here supporting you
00:13:50 [W] thanks for coming to our talk and we'll stick around for some questions.
00:13:53 [W] Thank you.
00:14:07 [W] Hey, everyone.
00:14:14 [W] Well, do you questions and if you do have any questions, there's a Q&A box on the left side of the screen.
00:14:20 [W] And so please drop your questions in there and we will go through them will make sure to read them out loud.
00:14:26 [W] Yeah.
00:14:28 [W] Yeah, and we'll also be hanging out in slack.
00:14:33 [W] of course on Twitter in the maintainer track after this as well.
00:14:44 [W] So just start reading questions.
00:14:46 [W] Sure. Go for those with an Intel. Yeah, go and pick one.
00:14:48 [W] The first one so we have a question and it says do I need to change my behavior to conform to the standards of the community.
00:14:56 [W] What about my behavior on various social media platforms such as personal Twitter or Instagram great question.
00:15:05 [W] Did you want to answer that?
00:15:08 [W] You can take the lead say anyone one of our slides kind of showed a broad view of places where our complete Community come together and engage in
00:15:23 [W] Representing the community to each other which yeah might be on Twitter or might be at a coffee shop or in slack and words are all Community spaces when we're doing work for kubernative has organized knative
00:15:28 [W] Community spaces when we're doing work for kubernative a certain quantity of quantity of work and not only people should, you know have to change their behavior.
00:15:35 [W] They should already be behaving in a way that is inclusive.
00:15:43 [W] Yeah, I mean, I think the way I think about it. It's like we're not the committee.
00:15:48 [W] Is it here to like police here everyday life. But again if it if it affects the community in terms of like if you're representing the community that's kind of when we have that's when it's within our scope and
00:16:03 [W] It's not always black and white and that's kind of why we have a committee to help celebrate like how these things should be looked at.
00:16:10 [W] So I mean, you know like Ava side. It's like ideally you are respectful towards your community members in different spaces. And yeah, especially when it pertains to how a project is being represented,
00:16:27 [W] Yeah, also the code of conduct committee isn't you know defining what the how people choose to represent themselves or what cultures are here? We just want to make a space where everybody can be able to bring their authentic self
00:16:42 [W] Of their culture their background included and be welcome.
00:16:55 [W] Okay, so I've got a question here.
00:16:58 [W] I'll pick this one should I engage directly with someone who is not a bang the code of conduct on a public forum by like for example telling them to stop or should I reach out to the code of conduct committee think that's a great question and it really comes down to personal safety
00:17:13 [W] Feel is right and that you're comfortable doing we don't we are here to handle the harder stuff.
00:17:16 [W] But a lot of work is delegated out to unsay on slack. The slack admin team are able to handle stuff in the slack most of the time and it's generally small stuff like I mentioned earlier
00:17:31 [W] For spammers or someone just drops in and does something and they can take care of it.
00:17:34 [W] But if it's you know, if there's a bigger issue happening and you want help absolutely reach out to us and you can we address on on slack directly or emailed to the the conduct alias.
00:17:53 [W] I try to think of example. Yeah, I mean
00:18:01 [W] I want to say that like with you know, like if you are if you feel unsure about something right like we're here to help so just don't really hesitate.
00:18:12 [W] I wouldn't necessarily say that like, you know, you should only be child to us. If or just don't feel like you're burning us essentially right? Like we're here to help and provide, you know, like to help and give advice and things like that.
00:18:26 [W] So if you know like gave us that if you're comfortable
00:18:30 [W] Dealing with it.
00:18:31 [W] I think it's okay for you to do that. Right? But if it needs to be elevated, it's involves, you know different people or specially people in like higher positions in the community.
00:18:42 [W] Like we're definitely here to help provide that neutral voice.
00:18:45 [W] So I wouldn't hesitate to reach out if you ever feel like you need that advice absolutely.
00:18:53 [W] So it says are there any questions or things a project should consider When selecting people in their project to handle code of conduct reports?
00:18:59 [W] That's a yeah read question.
00:19:05 [W] So that to paraphrase is like how should
00:19:09 [W] how does one go about selecting who to be on a code of conduct committee the that's what that sounds like to me and I would say that each of the members of the committee both last term and this term have different backgrounds and different experiences.
00:19:25 [W] One of us has all the qualities necessary. But together we bring different voices different experiences and perspectives on how to how to view issues when they do arise how to support Community or reach out to people that are
00:19:34 [W] sure of what to do in a situation where something feels wrong where they feel threatened and so look for folks who have perhaps the sort of the emotional IQ or having a background in any
00:19:43 [W] To learn more support or therapeutic role or a crisis hotline experience.
00:19:48 [W] Those are some of the of the things but also folks who are Community leaders who are experienced at at leading an open source project that has a track record of being inclusive. How do you think Karen?
00:20:00 [W] Yeah, I think that's actually that last part. It's like people who are leaders in the space tend to be trusted people in the community so that I think will help a lot with like people feeling comfortable to have these conversations.
00:20:15 [W] Also just like having a good diverse group of people on your committee, you know, making sure like that.
00:20:22 [W] I've been works for like the same company or if they do like putting a limit on the number of people from like one company and that's one of the things that this current committee does. I think there can only be one is it bus tickets to
00:20:37 [W] Max and then of course, the other thing is thinking of
00:20:42 [W] Yeah, anything else you want to add?
00:20:45 [W] Hmm?
00:20:46 [W] I think the strength of the committee comes from the diversity of the members in it.
00:20:52 [W] We all approach things differently, right?
00:20:55 [W] So really try to look for building a rounded committee. If you can get more than you know more than just one or two people to support your project if you if you need that.
00:21:07 [W] So what are your thoughts on like to like our current committee, you know was selected by the steering committee though, right?
00:21:16 [W] But not every project has a steering committee to kind of make those decisions.
00:21:20 [W] Are there any differences that my apply to our project that doesn't have a steering committee in terms of having like if that's the case then like what the project manager is be the ones to elect people to be on the committee with a themselves
00:21:35 [W] so one of the
00:21:38 [W] the difficulties with building inclusive spaces that we've seen in some other large well-known spaces and I don't want to get too specific. But if you've been tracking up, you know big projects you may have seen some where the very leaders of the product where
00:21:53 [W] Into called in for some of their behavior that was harming members of their community.
00:21:50 [W] And so the way that we've chosen to structure kubernative is a dresses and prevents that by setting up parallel power structure. If you will where steering and code of conduct work hand-in-hand, but there's not a reporting relationship
00:22:05 [W] It to check each other.
00:22:06 [W] And as we thought that was an important thing to set up.
00:22:09 [W] To avoid some of the kinds of situations that have happened in other communities.
00:22:14 [W] We know it's all about learning from each other and learning from our past experiences, right?
00:22:28 [W] Okay, there's another question.
00:22:30 [W] It seems like some of the code of conduct violations come from Target's towards minority groups and or demographic backgrounds the seems like a device diversity issue.
00:22:41 [W] It's very diversity and inclusion committee that works on educating the community around this.
00:22:50 [W] We have said contribute X, which is not exactly that but that is a very active group working on building a good contribute experience and contributor onboarding pathways.
00:23:00 [W] And I know they focus a lot on making sure those pathways are inclusive.
00:23:05 [W] We now have the inclusive naming working group that just spun up this year.
00:23:09 [W] That's really focused on making the the language and terminology in the kubernative project being more inclusive, but that's not maybe
00:23:19 [W] with the questions about maybe it is
00:23:23 [W] maybe it's something we need to work more on.
00:23:26 [W] Which is not exactly that but that is a very active group working on building a good contribute experience and contributor onboarding Pathways. And I know they focus a lot on making sure those pathways are inclusive.
00:23:38 [W] We now have the inclusive naming working group that just spun up this year.
00:23:41 [W] That's really focused on making the language and terminology in the kubernative project being more inclusive.
00:23:50 [W] But that's not maybe not collide with the questions about maybe it is.
00:23:56 [W] Maybe it's something we need to work more on.
00:23:59 [W] Yeah, that's a good point though.
00:24:03 [W] I mean, I think we are trying to on our end trying to like compile resources that we can share with groups when they come and ask for that information. But as of right now, I don't think there's like a converted.
00:24:16 [W] sorry concerted effort around that in terms of another, you know diversity and inclusion committee per se.
00:24:26 [W] Okay, another question, what should someone do if they're involved with a code of conduct violation or in curry, does it necessarily have to be a violation?
00:24:38 [W] hmm
00:24:44 [W] is it depends on the involvement?
00:24:46 [W] My doubts that's a broad statement.
00:24:48 [W] They could be a witness to something that you know could say.
00:24:51 [W] Hey I saw this thing and it doesn't feel right.
00:24:53 [W] I saw this message on you'd have or this or whatever or they could be the person who's choosing to report or come to the counter committee saying hey, I someone that a thing it doesn't it's not right help.
00:25:08 [W] Or they could be on the receiving end of someone else who feels they've been harming involved is as broad.
00:25:17 [W] I don't know. What do you think?
00:25:18 [W] Violation or in curry does it necessarily have to be a violation?
00:25:23 [W] hmm
00:25:29 [W] Is it depends on the involvement?
00:25:32 [W] And that's that's a broad statement.
00:25:33 [W] They could be a witness to something that you know could say.
00:25:36 [W] Hey I saw this thing and it doesn't feel right.
00:25:39 [W] I saw this message on you'd have or this or whatever or they could be the person who's choosing to report or come to the counter committee saying hey, I someone did a thing.
00:25:49 [W] doesn't it's not right help.
00:25:54 [W] Or they could be on the receiving end of someone else who feels even harmik involved is is Broad.
00:26:00 [W] I don't know. What do you think?
00:26:05 [W] yeah, I mean, I think no matter what angle you're coming in from a professional like we're not a scary group and you know, our goal here isn't to punish anyone so really like for us a lot of times when
00:26:58 [W] There's an inquiry like, you know, like I think one of the first steps that we try to do is try to figure out all the facts, right? So depending on the situation like well, we've talked to the people that we feel like we need to in order to get more facts if that makes sense.
00:27:11 [W] But yeah, you know don't be aggressive down attack the code of conduct don't or the people involved right like it's best when everyone works together to figure out the details
00:27:26 [W] Our to figure out the details and the context of what happened.
00:27:30 [W] And yeah, I just know that you know, I would like to ask people to trust the committee, you know, we do our best to be fair.
00:27:39 [W] And again, we're really focused on taking a restorative approach and healing the community. So yeah just be professional and honest I guess.
00:27:52 [W] Yeah, and I'll Trust in what makes this community so
00:27:55 [W] So strong and great and that's how much we care for each other and you know that we're like Karen said and you know, it's such a big such an important point.
00:28:05 [W] I want to reiterate it. Like we're not here to punish anybody.
00:28:08 [W] anybody. This is all about keeping the community especially right now when we're not able to gather in person and it's all a little more stressful coming together as often as we can.
00:28:44 [W] We're coming up on the end.
00:28:47 [W] I just got a webcast message.
00:28:49 [W] I think there's a coupon being cleaner track last channel number Tina bullet.
