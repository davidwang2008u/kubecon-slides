00:00:00 [W] Hello.
00:00:00 [W] Thank you very much for joining us. If you are a kubernative maintainer, welcome, we're happy to see you on this maintainer track. And if you're joining us from the elephant loodse of language community meeting that happened earlier are on we are also super excited to see you and to go into a bit more detail
00:00:15 [W] In kubernative to create a space that's more inclusive particularly and use of our language.
00:00:22 [W] My name is Celeste Argan. I'm a senior technical writer here at the Linux foundation. And I am going to take you on a deep dive of what we're doing here in a working group naming. So therefore leads for the naming working group myself
00:00:37 [W] Nation Stephen Augustus and engineer with VMware Zach Coral Ison a technical writer with the Linux foundation and J singer Dumars and engineering manager with apple and the four of us have come together to achieve one specific goal for the
00:00:35 [W] Act and that is evaluating the language and naming choices within the kubernative project the specific initial focus of replacing harmful language with neutral terms whenever possible for the purposes of the naming working group.
00:00:47 [W] Finding is quote unquote.
00:00:46 [W] Harmful is language.
00:00:49 [W] that is racist sexist homophobic transphobic ableist or discriminatory in general against any protected or historically underrepresented groups particularly with in a North American context.
00:01:04 [W] Big mission. So this is something that tends to scare a lot of Engineers particularly when we talk about language and renaming features in code because it's viewed as not necessarily as
00:01:19 [W] Ring new features, but potentially really difficult to actually execute on and really really controversial.
00:01:24 [W] So let's let's go into a few examples of what we're trying to do with the naming group working group and why that's important.
00:01:34 [W] So we're going to dive way back into kubernative history now.
00:01:38 [W] So the year is 2016 and Once Upon a Time slightly before dinner availability of kubernative.
00:01:45 [W] He's 1.3. I believe there's a feature called pet set.
00:01:50 [W] And if you're like me someone new to the kubernative community.
00:01:56 [W] This might be really confusing to you and you might know it as stateful set because it was in fact renamed before it went generally available.
00:02:05 [W] And the impetus for that was this image issue by Jimmy Carter era, which I think outlines really well and its language.
00:02:14 [W] Why would this is something that we're interested in doing? So let's dive a little bit into what Jimmy said in his issue description.
00:02:23 [W] The name pets set is derived from the common metaphor and infrastructure of pets versus cattle. The pet has a personal and emotional value to yugabyte.
00:02:33 [W] You but the cattle is just a commodity.
00:02:35 [W] Available and the impetus for that was this image issue by Jimmy Carter era, which I think outlines really well and its language.
00:02:42 [W] Why would this is something that we're interested in doing? So let's dive a little bit into what Jimmy said in his issue description.
00:02:51 [W] name pets set is derived from the common metaphor and infrastructure of pets versus cattle. The pet has a personal and emotional.
00:03:01 [W] Value to you, but the cattle is just a commodity.
00:03:05 [W] Try to think about how our language perpetuates our culture and our beliefs in the same way that homophobic or racist language was and in some cases still is commonplace and accepted in days past in the modern world.
00:03:19 [W] We generally recognized that this language is unacceptable because it promotes a negative world view that we have progressed past.
00:03:26 [W] Imagine how angry people would be if this feature will called wife set and the analogy were wives versus bar hookups, so
00:03:35 [W] Jimmy did a incredible job of describing the value of names and why we need to care about them in our code here and he breaks it out into two pieces. Really. Well the first is this idea of using a metaphor
00:03:52 [W] How angry people would be at the spiritual world called wife set and the analogy were wives versus bar hookups.
00:03:59 [W] So I think Jimmy did a incredible job of describing the value of names and why we need to care about them in our code here and he breaks it out into two pieces. Really? Well the first is this idea of
00:04:14 [W] Very culturally specific how I treat my pet may not be how you treat you pot and there are cultures.
00:04:20 [W] We're having pets is not necessarily as commonplace or where pets server very specific purpose aside from enjoyment and emotional attachment.
00:04:30 [W] So the first thing that we need to address with this idea of pets at versus stateful set is whether a metaphor is something we actually want to be using in our code and from my perspective as a
00:04:43 [W] Technical writer the answer is no the second is maybe the more important bit which is the fact that our language perpetuates our cultures in our beliefs.
00:04:55 [W] The kubernative community is quite large a typical kind of in-person coop called runs about 10,000 people and there are two or three of those a year, which means we have a reach of about 30,000 people and that's the bare minimum.
00:05:07 [W] Those are the people who can show up to a convention the contributor Community is about 700 people large and that's another huge huge community in comparison to many open source projects.
00:05:18 [W] We have an incredible ability, but also burden to develop specific kinds of culture and
00:05:25 [W] Need to be very very mindful about what kind of culture we are trying to create and perpetuate and whether we really want to carry things from our past either as technologists or as people into our presence in our future
00:05:42 [W] The kubernative community is quite large a typical kind of in-person coop called runs about 10,000 people and there are two or three of those a year, which means we have a reach of about 30,000 people and that's the bare minimum.
00:05:54 [W] Those are the people who can show up to a convention the contributor Community is about 700 people large and that's another huge huge community in comparison to many open source projects.
00:06:05 [W] We have an incredible ability, but also burden to develop specific kinds of culture and weaveworks.
00:06:12 [W] need to be very very mindful about what kind of culture we are trying to create and perpetuate and whether we really want to carry things from our past either as technologists or as people into our presence in our future
00:07:27 [W] Of the ways that we carry these things.
00:07:31 [W] So I think I think Jim did a great job describing that there.
00:07:35 [W] But let's look at another example.
00:07:36 [W] So now the years 2017 and we have an issue in kubernative website about renaming Master components to a more inclusive synonym.
00:07:47 [W] So this is something that's on a lot of people's minds right now in response to the black lives matter protests that began in America in June 29th 2020, but I think it's important to know that this has been on
00:08:03 [W] As for a really long time now and we can bring up another example from last year about in kubernative.
00:08:11 [W] We've chosen to use the word control plane over Master, but we're not super consistent about that yet.
00:08:17 [W] But I think the point that I'm trying to make here is this is something that's come up in our community again and again and again and when something comes up again and again, and again, it's usually ID a good idea to do something about it, which is why
00:08:32 [W] This working group.
00:08:27 [W] the kubenetes community is a super positive place, but it's also would be good. If we stopped pouring energy into this repeatedly over the years by taking a stance saying this is what we recommend instead of
00:08:42 [W] Will terms and then moving forward?
00:08:37 [W] I think the other thing to note is this was definitely a working group that was formed from that need to do something that I think all of us felt in June and July of 2020
00:08:53 [W] Is violence as the sign says and I think we all felt a great need to do something positive in our communities to support people who are otherwise underrepresented.
00:09:06 [W] So so what is the working group naming actually doing?
00:09:13 [W] The working group namings formal deliverable is to create recommendations for replacing problematic language in the kubernative project from there.
00:09:25 [W] There's a handoff process of recommendations to steering and steering kind of
00:09:31 [W] Enables those to be implemented by the different cigs involves by giving their approval as well.
00:09:37 [W] The other thing that we looked at doing with the kubernative project was creating a framework by which we could evaluate language going forward and creating a process by which when a term was identified
00:09:53 [W] the community could handle it without necessarily needing a working group our goal in a lot of ways is to disband so
00:09:59 [W] On that last Point, let's talk a little bit about how we evaluate language because this was something that we ran into in the kubernative community very early on and something that we spent a lot of
00:10:14 [W] initially, so
00:10:06 [W] Something we found a gap in when we began this work in kubernative.
00:10:11 [W] He's was the lack of a way of evaluating language lots of different projects and different companies for addressing words, like Master Slave and Blacklist or whitelist
00:10:26 [W] a little bit more broadly in addressing terms, like man-in-the-middle attack or being grandfathered into a situation but it didn't seem like there was a rigorous way of evaluating a piece of language these terms were kind of coming up out of the ether
00:10:38 [W] Is that had begun three or four years ago?
00:10:37 [W] So he saw earlier, but we weren't able to look reflectively at our own work.
00:10:44 [W] We were just sort of accepting terms that were floating around and we wanted to do better.
00:10:49 [W] So we defined a framework for ourselves for evaluating language.
00:10:55 [W] You can find the full framework in the kubernative community repository under the working group namings documents. We do intend it to be something that people can use and people can share
00:11:05 [W] there but we broke it down into three sections the first where what we call first order concerns the second and third order concerns as well.
00:11:17 [W] So the first order concerns were language were harmed was egregious overt and very clearly problematic second order concerns were language bar, which was problematic but had a less definite impact and
00:11:32 [W] Was that could use Improvement but born doing demonstratable harm.
00:11:34 [W] So we have a set of questions for each of these orders of concerns and our our use case is that you have a term under evaluation and you run through the set of questions for the term the more
00:11:49 [W] Have a term under evaluation and you run through the set of questions for the term.
00:11:48 [W] The more yeses. You have the more likely it is something that you need to consider changing but the concerns are categorized for a reason and that reason is that first or if their concerns are significantly more
00:12:03 [W] And and that reason is that first order their concerns are significantly more harmful than third order concerns.
00:12:09 [W] So even if you only have one first order concern that you've checked yes to and nothing else is yes, we would still recommend putting more weight to those first order concerns and slightly more weight to the second order concerns and running the evaluation
00:12:24 [W] And slightly more weight to the second order concerns and running the evaluation. That way we are intentionally non-prescriptive in in how many yeses or knows you might need from
00:12:39 [W] Or knows you might need from first or second or third order concerns because we don't want this to become a system that can be gained and we don't want it to become a rigid rubric that's never going to work for language.
00:12:52 [W] So really it's a set of questions to ask yourself about a term and as a general rule the more yes, as you have more harm the term may be doing but there are some harm is more important than others.
00:13:06 [W] So let's run through those
00:13:08 [W] Cern's really quickly and will give a few examples for each. Okay?
00:13:14 [W] It's a first order concerns are characterized by being overt regardless of the contract whether it is technological or non-technological.
00:13:23 [W] these are terms which clearly imbue harm. The second thing that first order concerns are kind of characterized by is they're very specific to an identity so you can attach
00:13:38 [W] Meaning in the term that is very specific to specific people.
00:13:44 [W] And the questions we asked ourselves to clarify whether something is harmful in a first-order concern way is if the terms are overtly racist if it is overtly sexist transphobic or pejorative about her gender identity
00:13:59 [W] the ablest pejorative or to nerver this at that to neurodiverse or disabled people and if the term is overtly homophobic, so a really good example of a first-order concern is
00:14:03 [W] Asleep, we're while master potentially has other connotations slave is very clearly racist particularly in an American context and while kubernative is an International Community many of us are based
00:14:14 [W] And in an American context a slave means of black person.
00:14:15 [W] So for us this is a first-order concern that we are answering a huge affirmative to and something that we feel very strongly that we need to address within the community.
00:14:29 [W] So second order concerns are things that are harmful.
00:14:33 [W] They're a little less specific and these are characterized in two ways typically by a bit more ambiguity in terms of language and that is lack of of specific identity.
00:14:45 [W] So in terms of ambiguity within code and in with in some contexts outside of code and Technology this term may not be harmful. It's sort of a ameri instana.
00:14:59 [W] Canary definition thing where one of the definitions may be a harmful definition, but the others are not as bad and it's hard to say what what the connotation truly is and the other is lack of a specific.
00:15:14 [W] Density in this regards. So whereas first order concerns were is This Racist is the sexist is this axis. This is why we can't really do the same for second order concerns.
00:15:28 [W] Two terms were the two things. We asked yourself for a second order concerns are whether the term is violent and whether the term is militaristic so a good example of a violent term would be kill
00:15:32 [W] So a good example of a violent term would be kill commands in the Unix system where it's clearly violent.
00:15:39 [W] It's not violent towards anyone in specific and with in Unix a kill command has a very specific sort of meaning of sort of terminating a process very suddenly.
00:15:56 [W] this has the potential to make people uncomfortable, but we can't say specifically whom another example of this might be master in a non master/slave context so master
00:16:11 [W] Dean or kind of a template or default State like the master key.
00:16:16 [W] There are many uses of the term Master which are not directly about slave-owning.
00:16:26 [W] But there's enough ambiguity in that language that sometimes it is and so therefore within our framework this is still something we would flag as a yes.
00:16:37 [W] So third Arctic and cern's are things which are not necessarily harmful in any way, but they could still use Improvement and these are typically around the actual language itself.
00:16:49 [W] So is the language clear is this the clearest term we could use are we making things seem human that aren't human or anthropomorphizing them is what we call them in writing and is the term idiomatic
00:17:04 [W] Idiom is typically something that wouldn't translate very well to another language because it has very specific cultural connotations.
00:17:06 [W] So the two terms are the two questions that we had think of in this regards. Our is the term evocative rather than descriptive and is the term ambiguous and pets at verses staple set is a great example
00:17:21 [W] Evocative but not necessarily descriptive pets at has meaning to us emotionally versus stateful set which describes what the component actually does
00:17:27 [W] I didn't perspective from a perspective of working in an International Community where we translate our documentation.
00:17:30 [W] We want the descriptive name because that will translate better regardless of somebody's colorful background.
00:17:39 [W] So
00:17:41 [W] once we've run through the evaluation framework for a for a term and decided that we'd like to replace it and propose some Replacements. The next thing that we like to do is to record our
00:17:57 [W] In effectively an architectural decision record or ADR documents and we chose this for a couple of reasons. First off.
00:18:00 [W] We didn't want to just hand a list of words that we felt needed replacing off the steering and off to different things because we wanted people to be able to see the context in which that decision was made and there's a number of different
00:18:15 [W] Text that we wanted to capture the first was the date and time in which we made the decision because as as societies progress, they typically get more empathetic and more accepting
00:18:26 [W] We didn't feel need replacing in the past in the future. We may make it just different decision. So we wanted to record the date. We wanted to record what our thought process was and what our justification for making this change was within ourselves.
00:18:39 [W] To record changes that other communities or other open source projects might be making to see if we were in alignment or if we needed to go in a different direction for our own purposes, and we wanted to record who what stakeholder cigs
00:18:51 [W] Direction for our own purposes and we wanted to record who what stakeholder cigs we were identifying as potentially receiving the downstream effects of this decision.
00:19:01 [W] So, this is our first recommendation that's been formalized for changing Master to control plane across the project and a big thanks to Aaron Creek and burger for peering this just a few days ago at the time of recording.
00:19:17 [W] so
00:19:19 [W] we have an approval workflow for changes that go through.
00:19:24 [W] It's pretty simple first off.
00:19:28 [W] We like it when people proposed changes via the mailing list first and we'll go over where that mailing list location is later on. This video are in our experience conversations about wording tend to get very long-winded very quickly and the
00:19:43 [W] Way of doing this asynchronously and allowing that discussion to fully spin out in a way that everybody is comfortable with the second is once things have been discussed on the mailing list.
00:19:53 [W] We like to formalize whether or not we'd like to make a recommendation through our weekly meetings.
00:19:58 [W] This is effectively a pre-approval step and once things have been discussed for a few days or a few weeks on the mailing list bring it to the meetings.
00:20:08 [W] We meet once a month currently. We're thinking of bumping it up to twice a month.
00:20:13 [W] So the next thing we like people to do is just as errands done for master control plane is to open up a PR in kubernative communities working group and naming directory.
00:20:25 [W] There is a template available for making recommendations.
00:20:28 [W] And for the reasons discussed earlier.
00:20:30 [W] We like if you follow it and the final thing that we do is commit that change and once the change is committed that effectively means a few things first off that you have the working group namings.
00:20:43 [W] Permission that we agree with this change second off that if we feel that we needed to bring in other stakeholders to approve that decision.
00:20:53 [W] You have those stakeholders approval and tacit kind of agreement to do the work and third that this is something that we can hand off to steering.
00:21:02 [W] And change than others. For example when changing Blacklist or whitelist to allow us to nihilist if there are visible API methods available API Machinery needs to be involved because that does constitute a breaking change and
00:21:13 [W] Moving through the deprecation policy for that.
00:21:14 [W] So by way of wrapping up I mentioned this earlier in the talk, but I think that it's sometimes A Hard Sell to do this kind of work because as I mentioned sometimes it
00:21:29 [W] Inches, sometimes it's very difficult.
00:21:27 [W] It's really hard to name things in Computing as Engineers.
00:21:32 [W] love to remind us. So why do it and I think the answer really comes back to intentionally create an inclusive communities.
00:21:42 [W] We're very lucky the kubernative project in that. We have a very diverse very accepting very open Community, but I think as the project moves forward in maturity. It's
00:21:55 [W] Oughtn't to remember that there were very key actors and very strong actors. Who did this intentionally kubernative did not become what it is as a community overnight and without intentional action, and
00:22:10 [W] Action that continues to protect that Community going forward and addressing the kinds of words that we use in our Computing is something that will continue to protect the community going forward.
00:22:19 [W] So it's very very important to do.
00:22:23 [W] So hopefully this all sounds great and a way now, let's talk about kind of ways that you can get involved.
00:22:28 [W] So first off join us on kubernative slack and in working group and naming join our mailing list where you can find the actual discussions happening and the decisions being made
00:22:44 [W] Unless you'll get a meeting invite to our monthly meeting that is currently set for the second of Monday every month at 10:30 Pacific time.
00:22:46 [W] And as a final note, and this is I think very particular to the people joining us from the LF naming group.
00:22:53 [W] Please take the work that we've committed to kubernative community working group naming and use in your own organizations. I think one of the coolest things about open source, is that everything we do?
00:23:07 [W] Ooh is publicly available?
00:23:08 [W] Nothing is behind a firewall it's free for anyone to use and remix and we a part of the reason that we made the decisions to do things like architectural decision records to create a framework and was
00:23:24 [W] I wanted people to be able to use this as a resource something that we've noticed is that there are a lot of different organizations and groups and open source projects trying to do this for all at once and not necessarily Consulting each
00:23:32 [W] So we're really hoping that what we create can also be a resource going forward for people so that they don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time this conversation comes up and on that note. Thank you so much for attending.
00:23:32 [W] It was lovely to virtually see you and what made me even happier is if you join us for a Q&A session after this talk, I really look forward to chatting with all of you and I hope you have a great afternoon.
00:23:51 [W] hello everyone can we hear me so thank you so much for watching this talk of and we've got a couple of questions from the flock that I just wanted to go over live and
00:24:06 [W] Q and A's in the speaker Corner if you so desire, so, um on slack. We have one question, which was how much overlap is there between replacing problematic language and the task of avoiding.
00:24:18 [W] Jargon in general and from my perspective.
00:24:21 [W] think there's a ton and I designed the framework specifically to call that out.
00:24:28 [W] What you're really asking I think is is is there overlap between metaphor like using metaphorical language and avoiding?
00:24:37 [W] Jargon in the world of computing and in most like professional writing if you're using metaphors it gets a little bit.
00:24:45 [W] jargony because metaphors are super specific to people understanding the context of the metaphor. So if you can avoid metaphors, you're usually going to avoid jargon and if you're avoiding metaphors yugabyte.
00:24:58 [W] Almost certainly going to avoid problematic language.
00:25:01 [W] So thank you so much for that. First question. And the second question we had was wondering what the responses were like when the problem was brought up in the past.
00:25:12 [W] So in 2015 and 2017 to 2019 and what are the outcomes from that discussion that came before the working group?
00:25:21 [W] So the one I'm most familiar with is the mailing list thread in 2019 because that
00:25:27 [W] It had kind of been keeping an eye on that for a few years and I think a part of why we decided to create this working group is that there was no real outcome particularly in 2019.
00:25:32 [W] There was a mailing list and Sig API Machinery about hey, we should remove these words and everybody went like great.
00:25:38 [W] I totally support that.
00:25:39 [W] That's awesome.
00:25:40 [W] It sounds great and then nothing really got done and that's a bit of a disappointing result. So this
00:25:49 [W] time when the discussion came around there was a slightly different group of people.
00:25:53 [W] Like I was new to the organization and I was one of the key people involved in driving this forward.
00:25:59 [W] So there was a lot of positive spirit but not a lot of work behind it. And that's kind of why I really wanted to make the focus of this working group very much about making changes in the code
00:26:15 [W] These types of changes tend to a get a lot of positive response but not a lot of work and be they tend to get a lot of work on the documentation side of things and the marketing side of things but the code base Remains the Same forever.
00:26:22 [W] So the language of the developer uses continues to stay the same because they're looking at the code base so tldr lots of positivity not a lot of work and I
00:26:46 [W] Going three times.
00:26:49 [W] I think we're good guys.
00:26:50 [W] So thank you so so much for coming to this talk.
00:26:54 [W] I'm just going to wrap it up here.
00:26:56 [W] I hope the rest of your afternoon goes great.
00:26:59 [W] I hope the week of coupon went really really great.
00:27:02 [W] I've this felt like a super and like energized and engaging conference and I hope you all have a wonderful Friday afternoon.
