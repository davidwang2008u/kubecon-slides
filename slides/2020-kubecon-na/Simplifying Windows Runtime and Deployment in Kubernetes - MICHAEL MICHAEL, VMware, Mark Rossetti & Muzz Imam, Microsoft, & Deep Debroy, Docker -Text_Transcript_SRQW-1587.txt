00:00:00 [W] Hello everybody and welcome to the cubic on presentation on simplified Windows runtime and deployment in kubernative.
00:00:52 [W] Hello everybody and welcome to the cubic on presentation on simplify Windows runtime and deployment in kubernative.
00:00:59 [W] We have the team from sequences here that's going to present to you today and go over some key topics that we want to basically get the community to know about.
00:01:11 [W] Let's start with introductions must thank Mike. I'm mud. I'm a figment with contributor and a senior p.m. At Microsoft.
00:01:21 [W] Hey folks, this is deep the boy. I'm an engineering manager over at Docker and Tech lead and said windows.
00:01:29 [W] Hi, I'm Mark Garcetti.
00:01:30 [W] I'm a software engineer in the Azure org at Microsoft and one of the Sig Windows co-chairs.
00:01:37 [W] Hi everybody.
00:01:37 [W] My name is Michael. I'm a sick Windows co-chair along with Mark and I'm a director of product management at VMware.
00:01:46 [W] Everybody I'm Jay James Microsoft and engineer there and also contributing Sig windows.
00:01:55 [W] Thank you all so today we're going to talk about all the Investments that sick windows and Cloud native Windows Community have been doing in the last few months. We're going to basically talk to you about our future roadmap
00:03:05 [W] at the community to know about
00:03:09 [W] let's start with introductions Muzz.
00:03:12 [W] Thank Mike.
00:03:13 [W] I'm mud.
00:03:14 [W] I'm a big Windows contributor and a senior p.m.
00:03:16 [W] At Microsoft.
00:03:19 [W] Hey folks, this is deep Deb Roy. I'm an engineering manager over a darker and Tech lead and said windows.
00:03:26 [W] Hi, I'm Mark Garcetti.
00:03:28 [W] I'm a software engineer in the Azure org at Microsoft and one of the Sig Windows co-chairs.
00:03:34 [W] Hi everybody.
00:03:35 [W] My name is Michael. I'm a sick Windows co-chair along with Mark and I'm a director of product management at VMware.
00:03:43 [W] Hey everybody. I'm James. I'm Microsoft and engineer there and also contributing Sig windows.
00:03:53 [W] Thank you all so today we're going to talk about all the Investments that sick windows and Cloud native Windows Community have been doing in the last few months. We're going to basically talk to you about our future roadmap
00:04:08 [W] Runs and what that means for you?
00:04:09 [W] We're going to give you a dynamite demo on cluster API and then also leave some time for Q a let's dig in.
00:04:19 [W] - go ahead and talk to us about Windows.
00:04:21 [W] Thanks Michael.
00:04:23 [W] So in Windows operating system update, so we have a lot of exciting stuff starting with Nano server 1809 support has been extended officially to 2024 same as the windows 2019 LTS see support cycle.
00:04:37 [W] This was based on the requests. We got from kubernative Community the other one important that Mark is going to talk about in containerd as well as the single file mapping is now fully supported the from an operating system.
00:04:49 [W] If the bug has been fixed the DSR support long-awaited is going to be in October release.
00:04:56 [W] There's a huge one.
00:04:57 [W] And then the last one is 2004 support is for Windows server to the latest secre lease is now fully supported and is being tested in the tenth grade for kubernative. As far as the plan for we 120 goes. We
00:05:12 [W] Little bugs that were filed by the kubernative community that are being resolved.
00:05:11 [W] for example virtualized time zone for containers and in future based on this relationship between the kubernative in the windows OS team.
00:05:20 [W] We're looking at the changes for servicemeshcon.
00:05:22 [W] Michael's going to talk about session affinity for Pew proxy and especially MSM qms DTC supported scenarios in future with that. I will hand it to Mark who will talk about containerd e
00:05:36 [W] Hi.
00:05:38 [W] Yep. So anybody who's been following since when does is noticed that in the compute space recently were really just focusing on our efforts on containerd d containerd e as the container runtime provides a lot of benefits over Docker at least with the current Windows implementation today,
00:05:53 [W] Those real quickly.
00:05:43 [W] The first one is that it utilizes the most complete service V2 schema for those unfamiliar with Windows the host Computer Services Management Service that just helps start and stop and run containers the
00:05:58 [W] It's service fee one introduced with Windows Server 2016 and it was revamped its Windows Server 2008 teen some key benefits that that brings to the kubernative community is it allows us to address some kind of parity issues with features in terms of
00:06:06 [W] Is in terms of with respect to Linux containers some of those are highlighted here and that's with this new schema.
00:06:11 [W] We can support properly support single file mappings. So you can get an updated at CD host files into your container and also containers can just write 2 Dev slash termination log to get their messages in addition to
00:06:26 [W] Vic functionality containerd e is basically and the Cry of the container runtime interface.
00:06:32 [W] This means that when there are updates to the cry interface in general windows will just automatically get them. If you're using containerd D is you contain at runtime some specifics for what we're planning on doing and 120 is
00:06:47 [W] Containerd e support to stable that includes a couple of bug fixes a lot of documentation and addressing a couple known kind of feature parity issues the big one being group managed service accounts for everybody wants to run Windows cluster.
00:06:59 [W] And for security another kind of important one is we're working to enable GPU support through device assignments and some future things are investing in but not necessarily in 120 in this space. Are we hope to enable privilege
00:07:11 [W] Windows and the near future and are also working on enabling hyper-v isolated containers.
00:07:15 [W] Next is deep who's going to give an overview of storage?
00:07:19 [W] Thanks, Mark.
00:07:20 [W] So we have been mainly concentrating on the CSI proxy in order to enable CSI support for not plugins in Windows.
00:07:29 [W] We have introduced the new system API Group in CSI proxy this involves adding support for a bunch of things around querying the status of the service that's running within Windows as well as enabling support for iSCSI.
00:07:43 [W] We have introduced several new apis to the existing desk and volume API groups. This is mainly to support
00:07:49 [W] Operations like resize and on lighting off lining of disks and according to it the systems and policy.
00:07:55 [W] We are starting to support CSI proxy as a native Windows service so that you can just configure it as a service when you set up the Windows host and finally on the ci/cd side of things. We have enabled GitHub action based
00:08:10 [W] S that are fairly stable at this point plans for upcoming plans for 120 is to continue to add a PS to CSI proxy so that we can support the vsphere plug-in as well as well
00:08:22 [W] 120 is to continue to add a PS to CSI proxy so that we can support the vsphere plug-in as well as well as the general generic iSCSI plug-in on Windows.
00:08:23 [W] We want to analyze and improve some of the Layton sees that we are finding when performing Windows operations such as partitioning and formatting volumes.
00:08:31 [W] We want to improve on those Layton sees and figure out what's causing them.
00:08:35 [W] them. We want to introduce automated automated API documentation from and
00:08:41 [W] generate them directly from the API profiles so that we can continue to publish documentation.
00:08:47 [W] That's fairly up to date on the CSI have documentation sites.
00:08:51 [W] And finally we want to investigate smooth and seamless migration path from the currency as a proxy to the Future which is privileged containerd support in Windows.
00:09:02 [W] So beyond 120, the future will be to take in the future. We want to take CSI proxy to a stable State and more storage plug.
00:09:11 [W] That can be supported through CSI proxy. For example, the AWS EPS plug-in and finally look towards deprecating the increase in tree storage place against that Target Windows today in the next slide we
00:09:26 [W] From the currency as a proxy to the Future which is privileged containerd support in Windows.
00:09:31 [W] So beyond 120, the future will be to take in the future.
00:09:36 [W] We want to take CSI proxy to a stable State and more storage plugins that can be supported through CSS haproxy.
00:09:43 [W] For example, the AWS EPS plug-in and finally look towards deprecating the increase in tree storage place against that Target Windows today.
00:09:54 [W] In the next slide, we have architecture diagram of how CSI proxy enables a CSI note plug-in in Windows to communicate with the various components such as cube.
00:10:04 [W] Let and the CSA no driver register as well as to the host operating system to drive privileged operations.
00:10:10 [W] If you have questions around this, feel free to ask us in the follow-up or jump into the CSA Windows channel in in Slack.
00:10:22 [W] Thank you.
00:10:24 [W] Thank you deep.
00:10:25 [W] So let's talk a little bit about networking, you know, seeing a lot of advancements in storage as well as compute and we're actually putting a tremendous amount of effort around networking as well in the latest release of enabled DSR mode for load balancing as well
00:10:40 [W] As well as compute and we're actually putting a tremendous amount of effort around networking as well in the latest release of enabled DSR mode for load balancing as well as endpoint slices. Both of these features make it easier for you to run more applications.
00:10:55 [W] On the same note in kubenetes and we make it more efficient for you to run have more importance on your kubernative containers. In addition to that. There's two major changes are happening on the cni-genie log the containerd networking
00:11:10 [W] For kubenetes Calico has open source their Network plugin for kubernative for Windows could use a major major thing.
00:11:17 [W] Now you get a the great advantages of Calico and you can try it out without requiring a subscription in addition to that the anthracene I now supports Windows including support for Network policies. So now if you're looking to get started with Windows containers
00:11:32 [W] And you're looking at you know, you're never plugins and what can support your needs as an infrastructure operator.
00:11:36 [W] You have to grade cni-genie are made available for you in addition to that the invoice proxy which is kind of the base for a lot of other features in the cloud native ecosystem.
00:11:47 [W] For example, is Theo and contour and other English controllers had their Alpha release of supporting Windows.
00:11:54 [W] This is huge.
00:11:55 [W] Now. We make it possible for you to start trying out. What do you mean to run?
00:11:59 [W] And then we proc seem some of these capabilities like Ingress and another tools on top of Windows for one to twenty. Our plan is to promote Envoy proxy to Beta so you're going to see an advancement of the capabilities that are making it
00:12:15 [W] Start trying out.
00:12:12 [W] What do you mean to run?
00:12:14 [W] Then? We proc seem some of these capabilities like Ingress and another tools on top of Windows for one to twenty. Our plan is to promote and haproxy to Beta so you're going to see an advancement of the capabilities that are making it
00:12:40 [W] More more solid as a supported offering we're going to have an ipv4 and IPv6 dualstar networking.
00:12:47 [W] So that's gonna require some of the windows releases Windows release features in version two thousand four and then as well as external traffic policy calls local support for client IP preservation in the future
00:13:02 [W] From earlier we're gonna have servicemeshcon Port so look for support on osm SMI as well as others as well as IPv6 and ipv4.
00:13:12 [W] ipv4. You all start networking for overlay networks, so lots of advancements here and let's move on and with James on cluster life cycle.
00:13:23 [W] Yeah, so for the last few releases, we've enabled you to add Windows nodes and we were working towards making the sea even easier for you to add the windows nodes to your customers.
00:13:34 [W] So in a couple releases ago, we added Cube ABM support and we are now in beta with that and as we look forward we're going to be adding support to Cluster API cluster API is going to be using the cube ATM support that we did that
00:13:49 [W] It also be using some tooling that's out in the ecosystem around Cloud base that enables Cube ATM to boot these nodes very quickly.
00:13:53 [W] This will be support for workloads clusters only.
00:13:56 [W] So that's important to recognize that there's a cluster API.
00:14:01 [W] There's a concept of management clusters.
00:14:03 [W] That's what creates all your target workloads clusters.
00:14:06 [W] and so will be supporting windows in the workloads Clusters. And as we move look forward to the future we're going to be moving towards
00:14:15 [W] you betta am support for GA. And so I'm going to be doing a demo here in just a little bit on how we've started to add support to Cluster API for Windows.
00:14:26 [W] Thank you James. And I look forward to that demo miles, you know talked about all of these features compute network storage making it easy for people to run and our users to run Windows containers and kubernative and production. But the big issue is what do you do with all
00:14:41 [W] Those clusters and as we move look forward to the future.
00:14:37 [W] We're going to be moving towards Cube ATM support for GA. And so I'm going to be doing a demo here in just a little bit on how we've started to add support to Cluster API for Windows.
00:14:52 [W] Thank you James. And we look forward to that demo Moz, you know talked about all of these features compute network storage making it easy for people to run and our users to run Windows containers and kubernative and production. But the big issue is what do you do with all
00:15:59 [W] That are running Windows out there in the wild.
00:16:02 [W] Yeah, thanks Mike. And that's the one of the feedbacks and questions. We got four in the last key Point as well.
00:16:09 [W] So the so I think the first thing to start with the with the morning, I think Legacy application is of course a lift and shift your application from mono from monoliths to to microservices and the first step is
00:16:24 [W] need to do is basically try to containerize the application locally on your own computer using Docker containers and see if it works and and the general rule of thumb here is the web-based applications the simple dotnet
00:16:38 [W] The Legacy application which work great in your organization. You want to keep it and modernized infrastructure start with those, you know, the low-hanging fruit. And generally we seen majority of the application line to that the complex
00:16:46 [W] Fruit and generally be seen a majority of the application lie into that the complex application leave them for later now in terms of containerization of applications locally.
00:16:55 [W] There are many tools out there as well to help you write the dockerfile getting the first step going and testing it on your local machine.
00:17:03 [W] One of those is the windows admin Center which are lot of Windows administrators youth.
00:17:09 [W] We have a new extension called containerd extension and the link is right there.
00:17:13 [W] You can go and watch the video to the
00:17:14 [W] A cool tool to containerize your application locally to test it and then push it to a registry to get it started the last thing I want to call out before I hand it back to you Michael for more gotchas is the importance of Linux notes, especially when you were starting
00:17:29 [W] Especially when you're starting if you're starting with a with a basic kubernative cluster, and once you have containerized your application now, you need to deploy it to your kubernative cluster.
00:17:38 [W] Make sure that you know your control plane and the Linux node, which has DNS and their key components you pay attention to it because often you forget about them and they're pretty critical to run kubernative today if you have any more questions
00:17:53 [W] Kubernative slack or there's a lot of documentation in kubernative website as well on Microsoft website as well.
00:18:01 [W] Feel free to Ping us with that Michael.
00:18:04 [W] You won't talk about the gotchas.
00:18:05 [W] Absolutely.
00:18:07 [W] Thank you.
00:18:07 [W] I thank you much and you know like much mentioned it's the best thing to do.
00:18:12 [W] is you start slow you start with some applications that you lift and shift and as you get more knowledge about how to modernize some of those applications as you understand some of the gotchas.
00:18:23 [W] And you can slowly apply the same blooping two more and more applications because there's a lot of classes of applications out.
00:18:31 [W] There are other organizations are look very similar.
00:18:34 [W] So when the knowledge that you're going to get from modernizing some of them it's going to apply very equally to other ones. But as you go through that process you're going to identify some things that don't really work as well and some things that you have to note note into your as you're going through
00:18:49 [W] Us there's a lot of classes of applications out there at organizations are look very similar.
00:18:50 [W] So when the knowledge that you're going to get from modernizing some of them is cannot apply very equally to other ones. But as you go through that process you're going to identify some things that don't really work as well and some things that you have to note note into your as
00:19:20 [W] The image selection use derived images to share application building blocks and dependencies.
00:19:25 [W] Why is that important?
00:19:26 [W] You don't need to figure out how to put is into a base window server image start with the is derived image same thing for Python and other programming languages like Leverage The Power of Microsoft that produces these base images for you
00:19:42 [W] This applications in it. So you don't have to do that work.
00:19:44 [W] They're going to make sure they're patched. They're going to release them frequently and then you can just build on top of it in some ways. You're becoming operating system Independent by doing this be careful Windows registry of storage. A lot of Legacy applications
00:19:59 [W] Registered as a storage you have to figure out the way to redirect that output into persistent volumes or other kubernative friendly storage providers so that you can maintain that storageos.
00:20:13 [W] The ability to access that data as your application could be shut down or move from node to node in kubernative. Same requirement applies to local storage.
00:20:21 [W] So no just registry by local storage as well or usage of local databases kernel drivers or application drivers may not exist in Windows containers.
00:20:30 [W] So if your application is making use of those you have to identify them figure out if they are necessary in either split the application into different components or some components could still running.
00:20:40 [W] Virtual machines or completely re-architect those components active directory is a product. The OS level does not exist in Windows containers.
00:20:49 [W] You have to think about that and use GMS a that Mark mentioned earlier as the ability to reach out from the container into active directory assets.
00:20:59 [W] We care of all be careful of dotted version compatibility, you know WCF for example may not exist in dotnet core database requirements.
00:21:10 [W] Management other application dependencies, like for example Windows API dependencies like MSM qms DTC, you know, if you have old style applications using calm and they required the distributed transaction coordinator.
00:21:24 [W] That's something to think about.
00:21:25 [W] Or completely re-architect those components active directory supported the OS level does not exist in Windows containers.
00:21:30 [W] You have to think about that and use GMS a that Mark mentioned earlier as the ability to reach out from the container into active directory assets.
00:21:40 [W] we care of or be careful of dotnet version compatibility, you know, WCF for example may not exist in dotnet core database requirements certificate management.
00:21:52 [W] Other application dependencies, like for example Windows API dependencies like MSM Q NM s DT see, you know, if you have old style applications using calm and they require the distributed transaction coordinator.
00:22:05 [W] That's something to think about.
00:22:06 [W] Do you have source code for the applications of Dell dude many users that don't even have source code. So maybe you have to use process Monitor and Fiddler and other tools and kind of lift it up legation from is and put it in a container and trust me a lot of
00:23:46 [W] Of times that really really works and you can run your app in a container use the dotnet portability analyzer to evaluate your workloads and identify all the libraries and and basically requirements and dependencies that they have it's a great tool to give you a
00:24:02 [W] Requirements and dependencies that they have it's a great tool to give you a full view into your application workloads. And also be aware of os patching and how that could be applied because it's different for containers than for virtual machines.
00:24:16 [W] So containers you wipe it out and you restart new while virtual machines you get to patch them and maintain the same instance over time.
00:24:24 [W] So with that if you have more questions come and find our entire team is available for all knowledgeable in this we've done it many many times can
00:24:32 [W] Find us on slack as well.
00:24:34 [W] Now. We're going to move into the demo. So I'm going to stop sharing and let James to share.
00:24:43 [W] James let me make you a co-host here as well.
00:24:50 [W] Go ahead James.
00:24:51 [W] All right.
00:24:53 [W] Can you see the screen here?
00:24:55 [W] Yes, we can I think I need to.
00:25:03 [W] Do I need to do side-by-side here?
00:25:06 [W] I know it's your good to go James.
00:25:08 [W] Excellent.
00:25:09 [W] Okay, so I've got a video here of using cluster API and image Builder to start building images.
00:25:18 [W] So one of the challenges is just building that base image with all the best practices baked in and so there's a repository out there called image Builder and you can run a simple command and it will kick off building an Azure VM
00:25:34 [W] Your co-host here as well.
00:25:40 [W] Go ahead James.
00:25:41 [W] All right.
00:25:43 [W] Can you see the screen here?
00:25:45 [W] Yes, we can I think I need to.
00:25:53 [W] Do I need to do side-by-side here?
00:25:55 [W] I know it's your good to go James.
00:25:58 [W] Excellent.
00:25:58 [W] Okay, so I've got a video here of using cluster API and image Builder to start building images.
00:26:08 [W] So one of the challenges is just building that base image with all the best practices baked in and so there's a repository out there called image Builder and you can run a simple command and it will kick off building an Azure VM
00:27:39 [W] Several other types of VMS and then it will begin to install all the components that are required for cluster API so you can see here.
00:27:48 [W] It's installing making sure cloud based in its installed making sure automatic updates are turned off making sure all the base images are installed whether you want containerd e or Dockery installed.
00:28:03 [W] Figuring all those things and getting them ready at the end of this you're going to have a fully functional image that you can then deploy with your cluster API providers.
00:28:14 [W] So you see it ran through I've got this speed sped up so that it moves pretty quickly here and
00:28:26 [W] in just a moment.
00:28:28 [W] It's going to be finished with deploying the image and we can turn that final image into a cyst prepped ready to be played across multiple resources.
00:28:42 [W] So at the at the end here you get a disk URL that you can then reuse and then I what I'm doing here is transitioning over to the cluster API. So cluster API has a concept of a management clustered and so
00:28:56 [W] I'm showing you here is the management cluster and then once we have the management cluster run, we didn't deploy the workloads cluster so I could there's many different templates out there that have different types of
00:29:12 [W] Is we're going to deploy those out and the it's going to begin to create the workloads cluster.
00:29:12 [W] Here is the management cluster logs. The these logs are just showing you that the workload clusters actually being reconciled as it gets deployed and in a moment here, we're going to see that the first control plane
00:29:27 [W] Now this is a Linux control plane node, and on the right hand side.
00:29:21 [W] Now that that control plane node has been deployed.
00:29:25 [W] I can connect to it and on the left hand side.
00:29:28 [W] I'm going to query the CRTs for the management cluster and watch these components come online as cluster API begins to provision each of these VMS.
00:29:44 [W] On the right hand side here.
00:29:45 [W] I'm now talking to my cluster the workloads cluster that's been deployed.
00:29:51 [W] and you can see that the nodes are have come online.
00:29:55 [W] So we've got the windows knows deployed and we've got a fully functioning cluster here.
00:30:02 [W] So we've got all of the management cluster components that deployed and now we can deploy our our our
00:30:12 [W] Extra components on there. So we'll deploy a out the let's see here.
00:30:20 [W] So we're going to deploy out our flannel will deploy it to the Linux.
00:30:25 [W] Once those are all up and ready and running we can then deploy flannel using for Windows. And so now we can see that the windows nodes have come up and finally now that we've got that up
00:30:40 [W] Flannel flannel host is cannot work is completely set up will deploy Cube proxy to the cluster.
00:30:51 [W] So here we go and deploy Q proxy Q proxies going to take a few minutes to come up those containers will be created. And now we've got a fully functional cluster crop that can deploy windows and Linux nodes.
00:31:03 [W] So the next step that we'll do is we'll go out and deploy two different workload you components. So we'll deploy an is application and then we'll also deploy a helper pods so that we can see communication
00:31:18 [W] force between those pots
00:30:57 [W] So just switching over to default just to deploy out the is component. And then we're going to deploy out a multi Arch image that's going to be our helper test component so we can see that
00:31:12 [W] lay out the is component and then we're going to deploy out a multi Arch image that's going to be our helper test component so we can see that they come up on line here and
00:31:33 [W] Line here and in a we've got IP addresses and here we have the is service.
00:31:43 [W] We're going to go out and actually make sure that that got provision correctly here.
00:31:47 [W] So copy that IP address and open up a browser and here we've got is running on that workloads cluster.
00:31:58 [W] And then the last step of this is exacting into that test component.
00:32:04 [W] We're going to query the is cluster.
00:32:06 [W] And we also query out make sure that we have internet connection out to an external site and finally here.
00:32:14 [W] We'll see that we've got all of the pods and at the bottom here, you'll see that we have Windows Server 2000 19
00:32:27 [W] Stalker eee running on it and we were able to do a query and deploy all those those pots to it.
00:32:33 [W] And so this is an example of using cluster API a sure to deploy Windows notes.
00:32:40 [W] I'll hand it back to you.
00:32:43 [W] What a dynamite demo.
00:32:44 [W] Thank you James and the entire team both from SQL Windows as well as from the C cluster life cycle that's been working on this, you know, this super super exciting for me. It can make it easier for it admins and operators to deploy
00:33:00 [W] Colonel site and finally here.
00:33:03 [W] We'll see that we've got all of the pods and at the bottom here, you'll see that we have Windows Server 2000 19 with Docker eee running on it and
00:35:00 [W] First by basically defining just a uml for their clusters were giving us a specification and then we do all the work and all the plumbing together cluster.
00:35:09 [W] I've been running based on the definition and the desired config.
00:35:13 [W] This is great and it's going to make operation so much better and then you know top of that now we're going to make it easy for you to create your cluster. So now you can modernize your abs and run Windows containers on communities.
00:35:24 [W] as you've seen, you know, we have a tremendous amount of innovation happening.
00:35:30 [W] And seek windows and one of the things our Mark and I have talked about in community in the past and one of the blocks with created come and join Sig windows.
00:35:39 [W] It's one of the few unique opportunities you have in kubernative to work across the board of the entire kubernative subsystem.
00:35:47 [W] You can work in storage compute networking API cluster API have everything.
00:35:55 [W] So if you want to really touch everything in kubernative Windows is one of those areas.
00:36:00 [W] Cliff weekly meetings they're all recorded. So you can go and record and view all the recordings from past meetings. If you want to come in and help us write documentation and user stories or fix some bugs starting with the good first issue or even review or open PRS.
00:36:14 [W] What a welcoming Community.
00:36:16 [W] We want to need to come in and contribute or Mentor you or help you get started.
00:36:20 [W] I'm going to leave this slide up.
00:36:23 [W] The documentation that we have our YouTube playlist as well as are zooming.
00:36:29 [W] We're going to leave the last 10 minutes or so here for QA. Thank you all and we appreciate your time spending with us today.
00:36:53 [W] Hi, so we've got one question here up. And that question is do you need to have Windows cluster separately or can Linux and windows nodes coexist.
00:37:05 [W] That's a great question windows and Linux nodes can actually coexist in the same cluster.
00:37:10 [W] There's a lot of if you search on the kubernative is that I owe documentation.
00:37:16 [W] There's a lot of there's a detail.
00:37:20 [W] Write up about how to make sure that when you do schedule that that your pods and containers land on nodes running the same OS as the container.
00:37:37 [W] Okay, we're getting a bunch more questions now, so I'll just kind of go in the order that they're coming in.
00:37:43 [W] The kubernetes community GitHub repository.
00:37:40 [W] There's a whole bunch of information.
00:37:42 [W] There's a calendar where when the Sig Windows Community meetings on Zoom. Are you can just join there's a slack channel in the kubernetes slack org that you can join and just ask questions and there's a mailing list that you can help
00:37:57 [W] Raise any questions too and will try to respond.
00:37:57 [W] make some of these questions pop like
00:38:07 [W] there's another one.
00:38:11 [W] It says are you looking to implement the use of devices within Windows containers? The answer to that is yes or currently as mentioned previously working on enabling GPU devices for Windows containers.
00:38:26 [W] Didn't quite stabilized in 120.
00:38:26 [W] So we're hoping to merge that in very early in 121 And if there's kind of suggestions for other device classes, that would be useful.
00:38:36 [W] Please reach out in any of the aforementioned Avenues animal like start looking into that.
00:38:46 [W] Deeper James you want to take any other questions?
00:38:53 [W] Sure, I can go to the next one.
00:38:58 [W] So one question is are there any plans for Windows only kubernative cluster?
00:39:03 [W] There is a no plans for setting the for porting the master components of kubernative into Windows as of now.
00:39:15 [W] I think it could be done but not being looked at in the immediate Horizon.
00:39:27 [W] And another one is does AKs with Windows know to use Dockery or containerd E. What is the real difference?
00:39:37 [W] I can take ya. Go ahead. All right, unless you want to James.
00:39:41 [W] Is there so?
00:39:41 [W] Yeah, and it's on the road map to switch over to containerd d a lot of the differences are pretty specific to how.
00:39:52 [W] How that Docker eee and or containerd E interface with the the windows components specifically that host compute subsystem without going into too many details here. The Daiquiri is only able to communicate
00:40:07 [W] The windows components specifically that host compute subsystem without going into too many details here. The Daiquiri is only able to communicate with the that V1 API, which is more limited than
00:40:25 [W] One apis, which is more limited than what the functionality exposed in that V2 API.
00:40:32 [W] I think this is probably a great topic to bring up on our psyche channel of if anyone's interested we can go into a lot more details there.
00:40:57 [W] So I think I see another question here that says do we need anything special to make inter pod inter-service communication work so you will need a cni-genie.
00:41:26 [W] Depending on the needs that you have for your networking.
00:41:44 [W] Okay.
00:41:45 [W] I see another question and that question has other plans to run SQL server on Nano server.
00:41:51 [W] let me make this question public and then there's is a GitHub repository under the Microsoft organization specifically for people to file issues or make feature requests for Windows container support that would be a good place to
00:42:07 [W] post this question and see if people on the Windows team are working on enabling this
00:42:22 [W] so there's a another answer here about privileged mode mentioned for containerd e and will that be available for Docker so privileged mode will not be available for Docker this is due to the differences in
00:42:38 [W] So there's a another answer here about privileged mode mentioned for containerd e and will that be available for Docker?
00:42:46 [W] So privileged mode will not be available for Docker.
00:42:49 [W] This is due to the differences in the HTTP API layer that they use it. So it is only going to be available in containerd e at this point and the privilege is we have a
00:43:09 [W] S API layer that they use it so it is only going to be available in containerd e at this point and the privilege is we have a kept open for that.
00:43:20 [W] So if you go to kubernative enhancements and search for that privilege container kept you can read all about it in also comments on it and give us some feedback.
00:43:30 [W] We're still in the very early phases of of outlining what that's going to look like but planning to do the work in.
00:43:39 [W] 121
00:43:45 [W] I see another question here.
00:43:47 [W] And this question is saying that they have some customers with Legacy 32-bit binaries.
00:43:54 [W] And is there any thoughts on how to bring that baggage along to Containers? There are a couple of stalks out there.
00:44:01 [W] I know Michael Michael has one available online. We can hopefully find a link to it and edit here and slack later about just more kind of in-depth tips and tricks on how to containerize Legacy.
00:44:14 [W] Locations so first recommend searching on just Google or your search at your favorite search engine to see what kind of tips and tricks other people have are sharing for that.
00:44:31 [W] So there's a question about does window CSI drivers you application consistent snapshots with VSS.
00:44:37 [W] The note the are looking at a snapshot support down the line. But as of right now that support is not quite Big Ten. We are looking into it though.
00:45:14 [W] All right.
00:45:36 [W] I think that that's all the questions that I see here. If there are more questions you have feel free to reach out there is a slide and at the end of this or in this presentation to with all of the resources to do this and yeah if you're interested
00:45:51 [W] Said as just a user or would like to start contributing here, please just reach out.
00:45:56 [W] We're always happy to help people get involved.
00:46:00 [W] Thanks.
