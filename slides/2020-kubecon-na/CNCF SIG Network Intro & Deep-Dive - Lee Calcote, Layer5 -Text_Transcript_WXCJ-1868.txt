00:00:00 [W] Hello.
00:00:00 [W] Hello.
00:00:00 [W] welcome to cube. Con North America 2020 virtual Edition.
00:00:08 [W] second ever virtual Edition
00:00:11 [W] This is the cncf Sig Network intro and deep dive.
00:00:15 [W] special interest groups
00:00:18 [W] working groups something different than cigs.
00:00:22 [W] What's the difference working groups have been well known as tablished within the cncf for a good number of years.
00:00:34 [W] Special interest groups however are a relatively new introduction.
00:00:39 [W] Little about a year old now, they were initially formed to help offload the technical oversight committee or the cncf TOC different Sig's have been formed
00:00:55 [W] He's of Technologies.
00:00:41 [W] This sig.
00:00:43 [W] Yes, that's right.
00:00:44 [W] It's focused on networking and projects related to Traffic and protocols and the like we'll look at a list of what those projects are first.
00:00:57 [W] understand why this sig has been formed Beyond trying to help offload the TOC.
00:01:07 [W] The Sig has been formed in part because Network networks and networking have become even more important than they were in the past or rather
00:01:23 [W] Is quite important in context of cloud native and context of distributed systems.
00:01:27 [W] operations that might be performed by a workloads location
00:01:33 [W] have become distributed as those systems have become distributed as microservices and that way of architecting software has taken a hold as organizations that run.
00:01:50 [W] Systems whether that's a SAS offering or otherwise as they go to run these in a resilient way and part of that includes different Geographic locations as Edge takes flight and we have Internet of Things.
00:02:05 [W] Have networking all around a lot of different networking of various types.
00:02:06 [W] This city has been formed to help in general.
00:02:10 [W] It has not been formed to dictate to people.
00:02:15 [W] It's been formed to clarify and inform to collaborate in interrelate with the any number of Open Source projects that are within the cncf and outside the cncf
00:02:30 [W] organizations and on to Parlay efforts
00:02:28 [W] We're here in formed in part to assist existing projects and attract new projects.
00:02:35 [W] and our stewardship is
00:02:39 [W] should be someone prove me wrong if it isn't impartial.
00:02:47 [W] There's a collection of co-chairs here.
00:02:50 [W] Matt. Klein of lift can Owens of MasterCard and Me Lie Cal coat of layer 5.
00:03:06 [W] The Project's existing projects that fall in scope of this sig.
00:03:12 [W] Well, I guess we Mark these by Cube Khan and so the initial set of projects has of a year ago Cube con North America 2019 containerd network interface.
00:03:27 [W] ens Envoy grpc linkerd e Nats Network servicemeshcon
00:03:26 [W] Since then we have evaluated and assisted in incorporating new projects many in the in at a Sandbox level and a couple at in the incubation level
00:03:41 [W] You projects many in the in a sandbox level and a couple at in the incubation level BFE cni-genie Contour Kuma servicemeshcon face.
00:03:44 [W] And most recently from this past Cube Connie you which was held very recently.
00:03:52 [W] We've Incorporated two additional projects and at the sandbox level chaosmesh and open servicemeshcon.
00:04:06 [W] That we have this Cube Khan and that we're sitting here chatting at Q Khan ambassadors proposed an incubation level measure e and servicemeshcon formance at sandbox level.
00:04:21 [W] A lot of projects a lot of those had the word meshmark notice or didn't have that word, but there were built for purposes of helping operate a servicemeshcon ba servicemeshcon.
00:04:49 [W] part of the activities within the special interest group
00:04:54 [W] our to establish and help provide a platform for individual working groups that have different focuses.
00:05:04 [W] Didn't have that word, but there were built for purposes of helping operate a servicemeshcon ba servicemeshcon.
00:05:25 [W] Part of the activities within the special interest group are to establish and help provide a platform for individual working groups that have different focuses.
00:05:40 [W] So one of those is the universal data plane API working group or UDP a which is
00:05:48 [W] I'm to summarize it very briefly is essentially the envoy projects apis being formalized and proposed as something of a standard or
00:06:10 [W] working group or UDP a which is
00:06:14 [W] to summarize it very briefly is essentially the envoy projects apis being formalized and proposed as something of a standard or
00:06:29 [W] In that is related to but someone independent of envoy itself.
00:06:34 [W] The other working group that has been established over the last few months is the servicemeshcon group. We'll talk more will talk about the activities within that group here in a moment.
00:06:49 [W] The Sig Network like the networking working group before it as in it within its Charter to put out white papers to help inform and clarify
00:07:04 [W] hours incorporation of a a CNF for Telecom Centric Cloud native networking principles white paper
00:07:13 [W] There are also patterns and some reference architectures being worked on.
00:07:18 [W] We also encourage the community in general to come and present come and share with us.
00:07:23 [W] There is so much happening in this space and this sig Network meets twice a month, by the way.
00:07:32 [W] anyone who's here watching this video at Cube Khan or after Cube Khan, or even if you're not watching this video this talk,
00:07:44 [W] You're most welcome to come join the discussions time in participate in the presentations and be part of the the efforts that are going on.
00:07:53 [W] You don't have to be a cncf member or your organization doesn't have to be a member of the cncf to come and participate.
00:08:00 [W] So see how very little excuse not to come over and get into the initiatives that are going on.
00:08:10 [W] Let's Deep dive into some of those now.
00:08:13 [W] There's a few initiatives. We're going to speak about hopefully demo.
00:08:17 [W] Set of servers to do at scale testing of some of the projects that are being worked on.
00:08:20 [W] For those projects part of the goal of doing that at scale testing is to publish results.
00:08:27 [W] A lot of times those results have a performance Centric Focus because
00:08:35 [W] at scale systems aren't necessarily always available to each of these open source projects.
00:08:41 [W] And so when they get their hands on Hardware like that their focus tends to be on performance.
00:08:50 [W] another common goal across the initiatives that were about to speak to is was one of patterns and in this particular case specifically servicemeshcon turns
00:09:04 [W] Let's look at the collection of patterns that are being.
00:09:10 [W] itemized and categorized
00:09:13 [W] This is a it's a small wording.
00:09:16 [W] This is a snippet of.
00:09:19 [W] Well, I believe exactly 60 patterns about how it is that people are getting started with using deploying configuring servicemeshcon.
00:09:35 [W] A lot of ways that you can configure a network consequently.
00:09:39 [W] This slide is something of a tease.
00:09:38 [W] It isn't possible to show all the patterns on here.
00:09:41 [W] There's a link to that sheet if you are watching this and you don't have the link come see me directly.
00:09:50 [W] I'll make sure you get it if
00:09:53 [W] You don't want to talk to me, then. Please visit the CM the cncf organizations GitHub. So it would be github.com / cncf and you will find the Sig
00:10:09 [W] Network you will find the servicemeshcon working group and a link to this sheet
00:10:04 [W] There are a few specifications surrounding so so by the way these initiatives if I didn't say it our a discussion of work that is ongoing inside of the servicemeshcon
00:10:19 [W] Again, kind of a sub working group of signal work.
00:10:16 [W] There are a number of discussions that revolve around servicemeshcon sophistications or servicemeshcon, 'z this tends to be a focus for us because for a few reasons but in part because the
00:10:31 [W] actions this tends to be a focus for us because for a few reasons but in part because the cncf is an open-source Foundation that's a neutral of vendor neutral
00:10:45 [W] and makes for a good platform healthy platform to have to bring disparate organizations together sometimes competing organizations and those that want to collaborate on specifications
00:11:00 [W] Occasions by specifications.
00:11:02 [W] I mean things like servicemeshcon her face SMI, if you're unfamiliar SMI is a collection currently of for apis for specs for defining.
00:11:18 [W] common servicemeshcon ality sort of the most common servicemeshcon
00:11:25 [W] functionality
00:11:27 [W] and it provides a set of interfaces that work within a kubenetes environment and allow people who are adopting and using servicemeshcon.
00:11:49 [W] Another specification that's being Advanced here is servicemeshcon formance or SMP.
00:11:55 [W] This is a standard for describing in capturing servicemeshcon formance. So characterizing both the overhead and the value that's derived from a mesh.
00:12:08 [W] And doing so in a uniform way in a standard way.
00:12:11 [W] lastly there have been discussions and work done with
00:12:18 [W] Service catalog exchange.
00:12:21 [W] It's about discovering servicemeshcon are resources their services helping establish secure connectivity between the same type of servicemeshcon this parrot servicemeshcon.
00:12:39 [W] It's also about providing.
00:12:42 [W] authorization and authentication of
00:12:49 [W] Which Services should be exposed to the other mesh, and what shouldn't what resources are available?
00:12:56 [W] Okay, so there's three abstractions at play here one of those abstractions SMI servicemeshcon her face.
00:13:09 [W] Has a number of adapters and by adapters. I mean both servicemeshcon are adopting this particular set of apis to the for apis that I
00:13:24 [W] After names too, but it's but they are traffic spec traffic split traffic metrics and traffic Access Control.
00:13:33 [W] As seven different servicemeshcon is have implemented and claimed compatibility with SMI.
00:13:41 [W] We need to Define what it means to be compatible.
00:13:43 [W] Hence a set of Hanson initiative around defining that creating assertion.
00:13:53 [W] Zettaset can be used to verify whether or not servicemeshcon fact SMI compatible in order to do that.
00:14:03 [W] Once you've defined those tests, you need to have tooling to deploy those seven different servicemeshcon.
00:14:13 [W] Then on board a sample application then generate ongoing load against those that those sample apps.
00:14:25 [W] and deficits and then run the tests collect the results guarantee the provenance of those results and send them back in centrally so that they can be reported on and and we can identify
00:14:40 [W] She's our conformant or partially conformant and which aren't and report on that.
00:14:33 [W] So there's been an effort to do just this if this sounds familiar to you if you're familiar with sonobuoy as a project that offers similar conformance testing
00:14:48 [W] Any with sonobuoy as a project that offers similar conformance testing for kubernative and validation of whether or not a software offering is
00:14:49 [W] And validation of whether or not a software offering is in fact kubernative is compliant or adheres to kubernative apis.
00:15:00 [W] There's a good analogy analogy to to draw between those initiatives.
00:15:08 [W] With respect to servicemeshcon formance or SMP.
00:15:13 [W] I'll take a moment to describe this one more deeply we described SMI some and with SMP I had said earlier that SP is the purpose of it and what is written into the
00:15:29 [W] occasion is that it well enables you to capture the details of
00:15:37 [W] your environment and that environment can be cluster nodes resources on those nodes.
00:15:46 [W] And the configuration of your servicemeshcon type of servicemeshcon type of workloads all kinds of variables all kinds of information about your environment the type of performance test that you're going to run the statistical analysis that that should be provided and extracted.
00:16:02 [W] Latency and throughput measurements that should be there and it this standard provides a consistent way to articulate and capture all that information.
00:16:05 [W] that's necessary to understand.
00:16:09 [W] the performance of this infrastructure of a servicemeshcon
00:16:15 [W] it facilitates and we've seen some of those that are engaged use SP to build out a new performance index and easier easy reference.
00:16:30 [W] Dex we'll talk about this in a moment.
00:16:27 [W] To do comparison between servicemeshcon to Baseline their environment and track their performance over time.
00:16:39 [W] The easy index that I was referring to earlier to just quickly articulate how how efficiently your servicemeshcon Ting is this effort
00:16:54 [W] Marker this new index called meshmark.
00:16:50 [W] It's built on top of servicemeshcon formance and leverages it meshmark provides a succinct way of articulating.
00:17:01 [W] How the overhead and the value both of how your mesh is running if you're familiar with app Dex which I suspect most of you wouldn't be but a quick Google search on app Dex with
00:17:17 [W] That would pull up a Wiki page probably and and if you grok that that's a great analogy to what meshmark is for servicemeshcon.
00:17:19 [W] You can learn more about meshmark on the servicemeshcon formance site, which is sp - suspect that I owe.
00:17:28 [W] Another initiative being worked within the the servicemeshcon group, is that of distributed performance analysis?
00:17:38 [W] And so here to tools are being married up the Nighthawk load generator from the envoy project and measure e the servicemeshcon ajmer plane.
00:17:49 [W] These two tools are being married up to be able to
00:17:54 [W] well again sort of achieve the mission of clarifying and informing to provide reusable tooling to all of us to all of you for understanding
00:18:09 [W] understanding and judging our your distributed systems
00:18:11 [W] if you consider that you have systems that are distributed, but if you're only measuring their performance from one vector from a single load generator, perhaps
00:18:23 [W] that's you probably missing a lot of other insights.
00:18:27 [W] And so the goals of this project include the ability to programmatically disperse load generators have them hammer on your services.
00:18:43 [W] I can currently or in cereal but to coalesce collecting coalesce those results perform analysis on those so that you can have a high fidelity perspective of the performance of your infrastructure from different.
00:18:58 [W] from different angles
00:18:50 [W] and so
00:18:52 [W] let's take a moment to demo.
00:18:58 [W] Maybe SMI conformance. And as we go to do that and I switch over to the demo mode. I'll maybe wrap up here by saying yet again comment participate in the Sig we want to hear from you
00:19:14 [W] Inform the agenda inform this the topics that we spend time on.
00:19:09 [W] Okay, let's switch into demo mode.
00:19:12 [W] All right, let's jump into a demo of one of these initiatives.
00:19:19 [W] For our demo.
00:19:21 [W] Let's review servicemeshcon.
00:19:24 [W] Ter face conformance the SMI conformance tooling.
00:19:29 [W] So we will look at both SMI and some of its specs some of its apis as well as measure e and its ability to
00:19:42 [W] validate conformance forgiven meshmark
00:19:46 [W] So measure e is the servicemeshcon Judgment plane, you can find out more about it and access it at measure e dot IO.
00:19:58 [W] Among its various pieces of functionality with respect to Performance Management and letting you know about your best.
00:20:09 [W] Whether or not you're running your servicemeshcon a best practice is Type of Way. It also does servicemeshcon, 'pliance. It's the official tool for verifying this conformance.
00:20:22 [W] on a Mac or you could be on Linux but to use Brew I'm going to go ahead and use brew and I'll go ahead and run measure is ETL system start this is how
00:20:32 [W] don't measure e locally it will go ahead and
00:20:33 [W] Download the latest version of Mastery start what is in this case a dock or application on my Local Host?
00:20:40 [W] I'm running Docker locally as well as kubernative locally.
00:20:44 [W] So measure itself starts up we can see that it will manage a few different servicemeshcon.
00:21:01 [W] will navigate and actually let's
00:21:06 [W] get a bit more familiar with my environment just to take a look around.
00:21:12 [W] It should be the case that this is yep.
00:21:14 [W] It is a relatively clean install.
00:21:17 [W] So it's more or less just kubernative that's here in this cluster. Great.
00:21:23 [W] Let's set up a watch here for
00:21:35 [W] pods in our environment
00:21:39 [W] Go over to make this a little bigger.
00:21:42 [W] Let's go over to open servicemeshcon.
00:21:44 [W] This mesh in our cluster.
00:21:48 [W] and
00:21:50 [W] while that's coming up, which we can see some changes happening here.
00:21:54 [W] We note that there are different adapters which means different servicemeshcon supported which is important for SMI conformance because there are
00:22:09 [W] unique servicemeshcon mlops servicemeshcon
00:22:09 [W] linkerd e is the on Console all are to be conformant with SMI all claim compatibility if we take a look at the sto adapter. There's a number of
00:22:24 [W] of pieces of functionality that you can
00:22:29 [W] Work with it.
00:22:31 [W] Looks like we've got SMI up fairly quickly.
00:22:33 [W] Let's go back to SMI.
00:22:38 [W] Wow, osm rather open sir. Smash.
00:22:41 [W] Let's go back to open servicemeshcon.
00:22:42 [W] This Mash.
00:22:44 [W] Let's go ahead and invoke the SMI conformance tests. And so we're seeing a small workloads being created to orchestrate SMI conformance testing. This testing actually takes a little while.
00:23:01 [W] Looks like we're starting to run some some additional workloads are coming up.
00:23:06 [W] It'll take longer than we probably have time for results will be sent back to measure e for publication SMI results can be looked at under the conformance area.
00:23:21 [W] Let's make this a little bigger.
00:23:22 [W] We've run three different tests here.
00:23:26 [W] Just just earlier today.
00:23:30 [W] Smash.
00:23:29 [W] Let's go back to open servicemeshcon.
00:23:38 [W] And so we're seeing a small workloads being created to orchestrate SMI conformance testing. This testing actually takes a little while.
00:23:49 [W] Looks like we're starting to run some some additional workloads are coming up.
00:23:53 [W] It'll take longer than we've probably really have time for results will be sent back to measure e for publication SMI results can be looked at under the conformance area.
00:24:09 [W] Let's make this a little bigger.
00:24:10 [W] We've run three different tests here.
00:24:14 [W] Just just earlier today.
00:24:19 [W] Right. Now the SMI conformance project is mid-flight in terms of defining all of the all of the tests all the assertions.
00:24:30 [W] that should be verified to determine whether or not a servicemeshcon form it to SMI specifications.
00:24:39 [W] So we're seeing traffic access traffic split traffic's back a few tests being run how long they've been taking whether or not the mesh itself is
00:24:49 [W] has that capability or as is not so I wouldn't read a whole lot into this failure here the both the conformance suite of tests
00:25:46 [W] Is mid-flight in terms of defining all of the all of the tests all the assertions that should be verified to determine whether or not a servicemeshcon.
00:26:17 [W] I wouldn't read a whole lot into this failure here the both the conformance suite of tests and each of the servicemeshcon.
00:26:38 [W] And so we would expect a lot more flying colors propun servicemeshcon the other six or seven servicemeshcon to implement SMI again, then eventually these test results will be each of the
00:26:54 [W] I can then eventually these test results will be each of the servicemeshcon will run measure e within their buildpacks s and publish results.
00:27:09 [W] good, and so
00:27:12 [W] the particular is if you're interested in what these assertions are and how that What What In fact is being tested.
00:27:21 [W] Well in there's a couple links right here in the deck.
00:27:26 [W] And again, if you can't find them in the deck, it's issue number 70 in the SMI.
00:27:33 [W] Project but there's a design specification that covers in depth.
00:27:38 [W] What each of these tests are what the sample workloads is that's being used for these tests and how that works.
00:27:47 [W] So cool good.
00:27:51 [W] mission accomplished on a an intro and a deep dive for the cncf Sig Network
00:27:59 [W] I'll say it again come and participate come and say hi come and ask some questions.
00:28:06 [W] We meet twice a month first and third Thursday of the month.
00:28:10 [W] You can dig into the meeting minutes which are public to get a sense of the discussions and what's going on and who's attending and
00:28:21 [W] but yeah, I encourage you to join. All right, if you have questions, I should be hanging out in chat.
00:28:27 [W] Bring your questions. Okay.
00:28:29 [W] Thank you.
00:28:36 [W] Hello.
00:28:41 [W] Good.
00:28:42 [W] Well, I'm glad that most of you hung out until the end almost all of you. Did you are some sick puppies? I think you're also here at the very end of Kube cons. So good you're committed.
00:28:56 [W] I'm looking through the Q&A if you have questions pop them in.
00:29:01 [W] I'll try to make them try to stop me if you can I guess let's make it fun.
00:29:06 [W] There were three years or so questions that were asked during the talk and for the life of me every time I go to publish the answer, it seems to go back private side either.
00:29:19 [W] can't figure out the system or I don't know but but a great question from Caitlin was
00:29:25 [W] Is the cncf Sig Network meet and while I can verbally prowl it off, it would be good to give you a link.
00:29:34 [W] I'll try to publish it again. We meet the first and third Thursday of every month at eleven a m-- Pacific the details though.
00:29:44 [W] only about when we meet and getting the actual calendar items, but also about the charter of the cncf Sig Network also the charter of the servicemeshcon.
00:29:55 [W] Github.com / cncf / Sig - Network.
00:29:41 [W] I don't know why I'm verbalizing this one.
00:29:43 [W] I could be putting that into the slack chat, which is where I'm going to be in three minutes from now, so I'll put it there.
00:29:52 [W] Good deal.
00:29:53 [W] All right.
00:29:54 [W] So other questions coming through good one of the questions is I will your will your presentation be available fantastic question Garrett actually asked that earlier. I forgot to publish them. And so I did just now they should be attached in sketch.com.
00:30:09 [W] Is I will your will your presentation be available?
00:29:57 [W] Fantastic question Garrett actually asked that earlier. I forgot to publish them. And so I did just now they should be attached in sketch.com. Also, there's a link to them in the slack Channel as well.
00:30:11 [W] So
00:30:15 [W] not very good.
00:30:16 [W] Another question is she's I said, I apologize to caslon not only so caslon asked a great question.
00:30:25 [W] One of her questions is you had a book published this week.
00:30:30 [W] What's it about?
00:30:31 [W] That's a very kind of question.
00:30:34 [W] Should anyone want something to fall asleep to this weekend?
00:30:38 [W] There's a free report from a Riley.
00:30:41 [W] It's a second edition book.
00:30:42 [W] It's called the Enterprise path to servicemeshcon.
00:30:45 [W] Architectures, it's a long title.
00:30:49 [W] It's a shorter book about a hundred Pages.
00:30:51 [W] It's been updated as of like this week.
00:30:53 [W] So it sent out.
00:30:55 [W] out. It's fairly fresh. I'll drop a link to it in the

00:33:51 [W] Environmental information analyze it and tell the world how much it costs to run a mesh who's running it.
00:33:58 [W] Well who's not running it? Well, you got me talking about servicemeshcon and now I'm like a minute over. I think the QA I'll be hanging out in the slack Channel.
00:34:10 [W] And in the maintainer slack channel for as long as I can stay awake if you couldn't tell I was fairly tired in the Talk itself. So but love to talk about some Mash were Sig Network in general again.
