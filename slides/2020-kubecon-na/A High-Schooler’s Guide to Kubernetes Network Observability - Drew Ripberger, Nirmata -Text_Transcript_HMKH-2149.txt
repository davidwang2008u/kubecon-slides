00:00:00 [W] Hi, my name is Drew Ripper murder and today I would like to take you through my journey and learning about the kubernetes ecosystem Through The Eyes of network.
00:00:07 [W] observability.
00:00:09 [W] 20 so I was part of the covid class. The probably went online at the beginning of Spring I find myself now as a computer science student at Ohio State University.
00:00:20 [W] And I got my start and in distributed systems through science fair, actually where I worked on a project looking at optimizing the basket zettaset algorithm.
00:00:29 [W] then if you look into where raft is applied, you see it's planetscale D. And that is there is then applied in kubernative to replicate do some replicated State Management.
00:00:42 [W] And replicate State data as to status.
00:00:47 [W] And things of that nature in pods makes everything synchronized.
00:00:53 [W] So really where I got my start in kubernative then is when I started looking for summer work in the winter of 2020 because I wanted something to bridge to give myself a little bridge between started my summer.
00:01:06 [W] Sorry, it started my senior year in the start of my freshman year of college.
00:01:11 [W] I also wanted to earn little money and this was something I was not really expecting it to get a job in software.
00:01:20 [W] the paid it's very very hard as a high school student to get this kind of opportunity because you know, you basically have no experience and what experience you do have is probably not applied and really all that practical but as somebody who
00:01:35 [W] As AngelList a lot for small companies and startups that may be looking for some more some less developed candidates.
00:01:33 [W] I found myself applying to an armada, which is a company that does day to enterprise-grade Cluster management tools mostly because they listed golang on their Angeles profile.
00:01:48 [W] I'll be honest. That was basically the only language that I knew to be I knew proficiently and then I was comfortable with
00:01:53 [W] being software and so I applied not really exciting to the position and they have actually been amazing to be sense and I have loved my opportunity working with them to develop an open source open source software over the summer and that is mostly going to be
00:02:09 [W] I knew proficiently and then I was comfortable developing software. And so I applied not really exciting you the position and they have actually been amazing to be science and I have loved my opportunity working with them in developing open source open source software over the summer.
00:02:25 [W] today my experience working with Jimbo Guardia and developing this tool kubernative kubernative see
00:02:36 [W] and just a quick reprieve.
00:02:42 [W] Jim is actually giving a talk with some people from VMware Alibaba and Google about the multi-tenancy working groups.
00:02:52 [W] I definitely go check that out if you haven't already for for Nevada, but the project that I was working on over the summer.
00:03:01 [W] it was kubernative and as the project was presented to me. It was an EPF based kubernative Network monitor deployed as a Daemon set and I'm going to be honest I didn't
00:03:12 [W] It is words even had to listen in to my calls or into my calls to the gym and try to figure out how he pronounced kubernative because I had absolutely no idea how to pronounce. It didn't want to say any of these didn't what they meant pronounce it kubernative.
00:03:26 [W] Kerbin nets for a while is what it is.
00:03:29 [W] But as I would find out EPF would be collecting the networking networking statistics. Prometheus would be exporting these and then this application would be deployed as a Daemon zettabytes.
00:03:42 [W] Set which basically means it is potty to note in the cluster as deployed by kubernative.
00:03:49 [W] But really what is the goal and why were we trying to develop this in the first place?
00:03:53 [W] As the project was presented to me.
00:03:55 [W] It was an EP F based kubernative Network monitor deployed as a Daemon set and I'm going to be honest.
00:04:03 [W] I didn't understand any of these words even had to listen to my calls or into my calls to the gym and try to figure out how he pronounced kubernative because I had absolutely no idea how to pronounce it didn't want to say any of these didn't what they meant pronounce it kubernative.
00:06:06 [W] Whoa to get a better sense of what was happening in the cluster.
00:06:10 [W] We were looking to get it to get all encompassing networking statistics, but the very very base layer.
00:06:15 [W] So how much traffic is going in and out where are things happening?
00:06:19 [W] And what are causing these? What are causing Mass what's causing this track?
00:06:26 [W] And using Prometheus this would give us very easily interpretable interpretable statistics to be visualized or process how we want it Upstream.
00:06:34 [W] So this tool is open source. However, it's very would be very easy for Enterprise solution to process these statistics and whatever they like really
00:06:46 [W] And as we can see, the really the goal is since it's all encompassing is we wanted to be simple.
00:06:50 [W] We want to drag and drop solution that somebody can easily easily use to get a better idea of the state of their concert.
00:07:00 [W] So here's what I'm gonna be talking about today my talk first.
00:07:05 [W] We're going to start off with really what is EPF and how we use it to do some monitoring and Gathering of network traffic and then we're talking about the track how we track these stats and aggregate them how we get a better idea of what they
00:07:20 [W] We send them to other other applications and then how we deploy this these binaries and applications across our class our cluster so that we can monitor the individual nodes then I'm going to give you just a quick
00:07:35 [W] You of kubernative how we tied all of these different components together, and then we're going to demo it.
00:07:31 [W] And I'm talking just to briefly at the end about what I took from this experience because it was a really really an incredible journey for me knowing nothing about kubenetes or the cncf ecosystem to actually be able to build an open source project in speaking with
00:07:47 [W] So I started forgetting about UPF which if you're not familiar with stands for the extended Berkeley packet filter and this while this might sound like a very big jumble of mish-mosh of words.
00:08:00 [W] It's actually not as complicated as you might think at its base and its base most basic level.
00:08:07 [W] It is a byte code that runs on the Linux kernel so you can run sandbox code very safely to interact with
00:08:17 [W] He promises them if you have any background or really do just about anything inside of the Linux kernel, which if you haven't heard of it yet might just immediately hit you as being very powerful just as of now, even though it's a rather new technology.
00:08:32 [W] Wracked with any process that might be having the background or really do just about anything inside of the Linux kernel, which if you haven't heard of it yet might just immediately hit you as being very powerful just as of now, even though it's a rather new
00:08:53 [W] occasions that networking observability security for instance psyllium as big as big user of EPF in the entire Village is observability space and Falco and security and
00:09:08 [W] As you can imagine there are really endless possibility Endless Possibilities what you could do with such a modular system.
00:09:16 [W] And how do we Implement BP bof?
