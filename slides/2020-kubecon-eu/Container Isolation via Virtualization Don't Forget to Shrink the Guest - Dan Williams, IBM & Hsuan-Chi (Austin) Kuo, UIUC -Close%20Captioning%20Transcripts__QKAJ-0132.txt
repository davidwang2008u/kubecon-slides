00:00:00 [W] Hi everyone and Welcome to our session and thank you for coming. My name is Dan Williams from IBM. And this is this is Austin a PhD student for on UIUC and we're going to talk to you about container isolation via virtualization. Don't forget to shrink the guests.
00:00:17 [W] Now if you've been paying attention to the containerless scape, especially the runtimes the past few years you may have noticed a lot of interest in virtualization and how the security and isolation of virtual machines can be applied to Containers.
00:00:32 [W] So here I have a screenshot from Keda containers which with the tagline the speed of containers the security of BMS.
00:00:46 [W] We've also seen things like AWS firecracker which had secure and fast micro VMS for serverless computing where this is a virtual machine.
00:00:48 [W] Seen as being used for for serverless, which is very much a container like environment just to kind of marry that virtual machine and container thing more together.
00:01:02 [W] We've seen things like we've ignite which which explicitly combines the firecracker micrograms with oci images to get that container and BM connection going so much of this stuff has been going on with the virtualization and the containers that
00:01:15 [W] - Phil Estes to write an article in 2019 called containers and try 19.
00:01:22 [W] They're calling it a hypervisor. Come back.
00:01:23 [W] but you might be thinking hold on a second aren't vm's kind of big and slow and heavy weight and and isn't some of the reason that we've been so excited about containers for runtime purposes that they don't have those properties like for example,
