00:00:07 [W] Hey, welcome everybody and thank you for joining this virtual session.
00:03:12 [W] My name is reduced dimitrov, and I'm here with Yvonne osawa. And we're both part of the awards open source Technology Center. Today. We're going to talk about a project called Network servicemeshcon.
00:03:17 [W] Hello.
00:03:19 [W] Looking for a good point to start from let's talk about the technology pollution through the years.
00:03:26 [W] First we hit those monolithic applications Rincon bare metal machines. Then the VM wave came out and we started migrating our workloads two virtual machines.
00:03:41 [W] We did that for benefits, like reduced operational costs Pastor provisioning improved efficiency and much more.
00:03:50 [W] No, it's all about containers and microservices here projects like Docker and kubernative are becoming the standard for such systems.
00:04:04 [W] Of course these Maps perfectly in use cases that are all rapid and fast adoption of new technologies.
00:04:11 [W] But let's see how this looks like Through The Eyes of a Telco
00:04:14 [W] So apparently Telco so moving a bit slower, but that's not always bad due to their nature.
00:04:26 [W] They prefer to use olive oil stablish Technologies in their systems. So for example,
00:04:28 [W] Will system evolved Through The Years initially Telco consisted of lots of physical boxes each and every one implementing a specific Network function within that system.
00:04:40 [W] Then they decided to dump virtualization. So all those physical boxes were migrated to Virtual machines.
00:04:48 [W] This introduced the concepts called virtual Network functions or VNS and it pretty much changed. The way networking was done for the last couple of decades and it is known as the first wave of energy.
00:05:02 [W] Now Telco so looking again at the Enterprise to leverage the benefits of the cloud knative world and for example, adopt Technologies, like kubernative in Docker in their systems this introduces A New Concept called Cloud native Network functions
00:05:17 [W] And some point gel goal would be to have a mixed set up of network functions.
00:05:23 [W] Meaning that bare metal machines virtual machines and containers live as a single entity Network servicemeshcon project that aims to be part of that transition.
00:05:36 [W] Let's talk about what you say network service.
00:05:43 [W] Imagine. There is an application and that it runs in the public cloud.
00:05:51 [W] It needs to connect another quote or to corporate intranet in order to consume some Custom Service that 6 volts and this opens a problem because usually the application
00:06:01 [W] Romantic the connection logic and the app doesn't actually want to know about that.
00:06:08 [W] why for example, what if the connection changes and what if we have multiple applications in that case, we would need to update each of them of them in order to apply those condition changes
00:06:23 [W] To do that every time when there is such change we can agree that this is not very efficient.
00:06:33 [W] So what we can do instead we can offer that to our network service that provides such functionality. In this case. We have clients that requests a network service. We have end points
00:06:46 [W] Mundo network service and the communication between them help us through wires that are payroll techno stood all these components form the concept of network servicemeshcon.
00:07:00 [W] So what is the TOC servicemeshcon?
00:07:27 [W] Let's see how we can describe the previous example of a network service in a symposium on file.
00:07:38 [W] We need to specify a payload type.
00:07:39 [W] For example, IP. We need source and destination selection in our example. The client was connecting to firewall and then pull you peeping Gateway. So in our Mo file the default
00:07:53 [W] Firewall and then pull the VPN Gateway.
00:07:57 [W] So in our Mo file the default match is going to the firewall and then it goes through the VPN Gateway.
00:08:02 [W] This way of service definition makes it possible to change multiple clients or endpoints and to create the so called service composition.
00:08:09 [W] This allows us to describe to the Poetry that serves our needs.
00:08:14 [W] How this example looks like in typical kubernative deployment. We have kubernative.
00:08:24 [W] We have Network servicemeshcon lot on top and we have reports to running one client and two endpoints what happens first, the endpoints are now themselves to network servicemeshcon.
00:08:45 [W] Team the necessary connections it injects network interfaces to all the pots and it creates a communication tool between them. And this creates the connection. I'll get a great thing here.
00:09:01 [W] here is that all this happens without any changes to the underlying cni-genie ni is great enough. So white changed
00:09:07 [W] now, let's do a little and see how Network servicemeshcon sin more details.
00:09:15 [W] The to live on every node, but have different responsibilities. We also use the k8s API as a registry for our Network Services.
00:09:34 [W] The major is responsible for negotiating the connection details and to make sure that the job will be done and everything is okay.
00:09:47 [W] Once we have said that details then we need someone to actually do the work right? Well that someone is the forwarding plane.
00:09:51 [W] Now, let's see how a connection request looks like.
00:09:55 [W] We start by deploying our network service via the Yamaha from before.
00:10:00 [W] Once our endpoint is started it announces itself to its vocal major.
00:10:08 [W] That's then save that information inside the registry on the other side. We have a client that wants to consume our network service.
00:10:15 [W] It requested from its vocal major.
00:10:23 [W] That's six for information about the network service inside the registry.
00:10:26 [W] Once it finds out which is the major responsible for not network service the two majors start to negotiate the connection details.
00:10:33 [W] Once this is completed they feed that information down to the forwarding place.
00:10:39 [W] Now, let's give a more Telco ranged example in this case. We're going to recreate it for G of a 4G LTE network using network servicemeshcon.
00:11:19 [W] Then we have the radio Access Network which which are basically lots of antennas or base stations.
00:11:26 [W] Then we have the evolved packet core Network or EPC which are a set of components each responsible for different service within that system.
00:11:37 [W] For example stuff, like user authentication charging gateways at named quality of service and so on.
00:11:44 [W] The output then goes to the data Network. For example the internet in this talk.
00:11:53 [W] We're going to focus on that box in the middle and recreate the network topology for the packet core Network.
00:11:57 [W] So, let's see how to do that using the network servicemeshcon.
00:12:02 [W] First we decide that each component is going to be a different pot Within kubernative.
00:12:08 [W] Now that we have a bunch of folks who want to connect we need to decide how to map that to network servicemeshcon.
00:12:16 [W] Once you simplify it will create the set up in such a way that the single body side with a client or an endpoint.
00:12:26 [W] Considering that the end result looks like the following.
00:12:32 [W] For example, we chose Emily me to be an endpoint and nature says to be a client.
00:12:40 [W] Once we have covered with us, then we need to describe the topology in the network service llamo file as we said before it consists of a set of matches and each March have a source selector and the destination selector.
00:12:58 [W] This means that the request is coming with a label marginal Source selector. We should put it for an endpoint with a label from the destination selected.
00:13:06 [W] For example es6 a is our source selector.
00:13:10 [W] Which is a label coming from the HSS client.
00:13:14 [W] And Amy is our destination selector, which is the label advertised by the Emmy and point.
00:13:22 [W] We complete describing the whole topology using that same approach for each connection.
00:13:28 [W] So, let's see how the KTM all files looks like for both endpoint and client.
00:13:34 [W] For the endpoint we specify the rental service. It belongs to in this case.
00:13:41 [W] This is 4G network.
00:13:46 [W] Then we specify the endpoint label will advertise from design point in this case. This is mme.
00:13:49 [W] To do so we specify the network service and the label we're going to advertise as a client in our case.
00:14:03 [W] This is 4G network and S6 a
00:14:05 [W] Now, let's see the actual demo of the 4G network port example.
00:14:16 [W] we will be using network servicemeshcon kubernetes.
00:14:21 [W] So we have a simple kubernative deployment.
00:14:26 [W] We have to not questor. There is nothing fancying it then we deploy networks servicemeshcon for structure using Harem. We will wait for a while until the department is done until of
00:14:36 [W] What's her available into ready?
00:14:40 [W] so once there was the department is completed we can see that there are two nsmcon e jurors and there are two forwarding planes each of them for each note of the poster
00:14:57 [W] previous examples
00:15:01 [W] then we proceed by deploying the yeah, no files that we created earlier. After that. We can see that each client and endpoint are being deployed here all the components that we already
00:15:17 [W] Out in the example.
00:15:23 [W] Once this is done and once all the parts ready this completes deploying the 4G network topology that we described in the mo file.
00:15:32 [W] This means that all the necessary interfaces and connections were created created by the forwarding place and that all the components can communicate with each other, but we now
00:15:44 [W] Need to verify that so that we have everything deployed.
00:15:51 [W] We need to make sure that it is created as we wanted it to be for that reason. We have a script that verifies the connections between each client and end point the the script Loops through all the clients and it brings the
00:16:04 [W] Funding and from and point for that client.
00:16:17 [W] We can see the successful pings from the output and three can also see the endpoint and client Port names in the same output.
00:16:19 [W] So what else can we do we can use a dartboard like Skydive to better visualize our deployment and what do we see?
00:16:36 [W] We see our to worker nodes being there and we can see the port's that live on each note. You can see the clients and we can see the end points for each pot. We can see the containers that live inside it and the available network interfaces has
00:16:45 [W] A good thing that we can visualize here is that we can see the pot to pot connections that are created by Network servicemeshcon.
00:16:51 [W] We can also see some specific information for each interface stuff like type State address near and it's Matrix.
00:17:01 [W] And this available for both nsmcon I created interfaces.
00:17:07 [W] With that we can see that having a dashboard like Skydive presents a pretty neat way to better understand your deployment and visualize it in a nice and simple manner.
00:17:18 [W] With that example, we showcase that anything makes it possible to have flexible and dynamically defined infrastructure using a simple API.
00:17:34 [W] I think really important for use cases such as Telco.
00:17:41 [W] Another thing to share is that we are also actively involved in the cncf cncf testbed for those of you that don't know about it.
00:17:46 [W] This is an initiative to evaluate how cncf architectures compared to the more traditional vnf. Once there are two already. There are two Network servicemeshcon use cases that are present there
00:18:00 [W] And there is an ongoing work by Ericsson to provide Network separation use case.
00:18:10 [W] What's next with the project?
00:18:15 [W] We have an ongoing motive rapper factoring that will improve the project structure. We have kubernative operator for deploying and managing Network servicemeshcon.
00:18:28 [W] We have we are working on support for multiple simultaneous foreigners.
00:18:42 [W] Also Erickson are working on the forwarder wait Hardware of holding two smart Knicks, and this will deliver a PCI pass through performance for clients and endpoints in the context of network servicemeshcon.
00:18:56 [W] We are also working on a cri-o V4 order.
00:19:04 [W] And for those of you that are interested there will be a seminar covering how Network servicemeshcon Andres the networking changes that quite knative Telco application space in 5G.
00:19:16 [W] There will be details and proof of concept on how Network servicemeshcon peoples the infrastructure from applications and speakers. You also give an update on.
00:19:26 [W] Of the network separation use case that is ongoing when the CNF base bag.
00:19:32 [W] So the takeaway that we see here is that Telco operators and service providers are actively looking at the cloud native world to build their new generation Solutions, meaning that containers and told optic system of portraits around them
00:19:51 [W] Be the next building blocks for that.
00:19:53 [W] Projects like Network servicemeshcon to provide features that will help to create those future systems and at the end be part of that transition and with that, I believe we've covered all of the slides for this talk.
00:20:08 [W] I would like to say thank you again for attending cover virtual session at Cube called Europe.
00:20:16 [W] We hope everyone enjoyed it and got some value out of it.
00:20:18 [W] Thank you.
00:20:21 [W] Thank you, and we are also open for questions from the audience.
00:20:23 [W] Hey, so welcome everyone.
00:20:32 [W] I hope you enjoyed our talk. So I will try to answer some of the questions on the live q a bar on the left so we can go over some of them for.
00:20:47 [W] Someone asked if if this code is available in Gates if there is some get ripoff of with it, so yeah, it is available in the network servicemeshcon who proposed story under the examples the examples repository actually the good
00:21:03 [W] In the network servicemeshcon ization on GitHub. So you're free to go and check it out.
00:21:12 [W] There are also a lot of different examples as well there which you can use to get no nsmcon.
00:21:16 [W] I can see a question for networks operations cases. There is a session right after us by Erickson who are working on this and maybe if you want to learn more about that, you can join
00:21:34 [W] And then directly ask them is the presenters are working conditions case and they can share any information.
00:21:50 [W] There's also some question about the result of question about the this webinar that you mentioned even if you can share more details about it while I also other questions.
00:21:57 [W] Let me check.
00:22:01 [W] meaning
00:22:04 [W] It's it's after half of less than half an hour. I can share a link.
00:22:23 [W] So there is a question if if any time can work across across different clusters of kubernative.
00:22:30 [W] Yeah, there is some there is an ongoing effort in dot. It's called inter domain.
00:22:32 [W] So I'm not familiar familiar with the details about it. But if you raise a question in the nsmcon OR slug, our community is very supportive.
00:22:46 [W] So add or someone else's probably going to give you a lot more details about it.
00:22:55 [W] I know there was a session yesterday on the nsmcon lon about this topic.
00:23:01 [W] So if you made it, or you can check the recording software that about it.
00:23:01 [W] I see a question.
00:23:05 [W] why Network servicemeshcon arses servicemeshcon?
00:23:32 [W] Layer connections. This is the use case that is converse.
00:23:43 [W] It just adds to the kubernative networking because kubernative doesn't allow a good point to point connection between thoughts and these are the two knows that nsmcon.
00:23:53 [W] So it's what makes it different.
00:23:57 [W] It doesn't care about the information is being Christmas.
00:23:59 [W] So there's another question if anyone is running Keda SM in production yet.
00:24:08 [W] There was a talk yesterday from Cisco that they had some interaction with Bell so you can you can check that out as well and see if they share more details about it.
00:24:21 [W] Also, is there any Telco which are actively looking at this which is actively looking at this there is a lot of interest actually about it.
00:24:34 [W] I know that Erickson are contributing with actually experimenting with some forwarding plane on their own for Wordly Planet based on their own.
00:24:48 [W] They had some pretty interesting stuff that they shared as well yesterday on the nsmcon soul.
00:24:55 [W] I really advise anyone to just go and see the recordings from yesterday's day Zero event. There are a lot of interesting talks about it.
00:25:02 [W] so
00:25:15 [W] I don't see any any new questions. So if there is something else that you want to ask feel free to join the nsmcon.
00:25:28 [W] Oh, it's luck at cncf.
00:25:31 [W] there are a lot of people there that will be willing to help you and yeah, just just make sure your answers are your questions are answered.
00:25:41 [W] So yeah.
00:25:46 [W] If we don't have any new questions, I believe we can we can close the session, right?
00:25:58 [W] answering writing while you were answering so didn't hear
00:26:05 [W] I think I think our hearings you having some some problems with your internet connection.
00:26:21 [W] Yeah, we actually there are some big companies that are interested in is our starting for proof of concept and working with it, but I don't know of any production
00:26:35 [W] Home yet Erickson are at one of the companies rate factor involved Cisco. Also, we will create some interest with the
00:26:50 [W] Ejecting were going to contribute.
00:27:00 [W] I don't think that anything developed is yet on a state or not production stage, but the work is on that direction.
00:27:03 [W] Okay, if we if we don't have any new questions, I guess we can say that thank you.
00:27:21 [W] We can say thank you for joining our virtual session.
00:27:23 [W] We really hope you liked it. And for everyone knows that for anyone that is interested.
00:27:29 [W] Yeah, like you can always join the nsmcon. Oh, it's like and
00:27:35 [W] Raise your questions there as well. We have all told some group calls on Tuesday.
00:27:41 [W] So feel free to join them as well.
00:27:46 [W] And yeah, thank you for joining our session. Thank you.
