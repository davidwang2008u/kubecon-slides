00:03:10 [W] If I'm welcome everyone to the presentation of topic Network servicemeshcon address Cloud native files a Telco networking challenges.
00:03:18 [W] So myself roshni with numb working as networking and connectivity architect at Ericsson and my name is on the Francie and I working as a technology specialist at Arizona.
00:03:31 [W] So these are the agenda items that we will walk you through today.
00:03:39 [W] First is why g&y cloud 85g system architecture and its complexity major challenging Telco requirements and different Telco traffic classes and also scenario of when to use secondary Network
00:03:51 [W] How Anna some can help and which will be followed by a demo using network servicemeshcon.
00:03:56 [W] White Cloud native 450g the main reasons include speed by adapting Market changes quickly scale micro service architecture allow scalability with Telco greater reliability efficiency by simplifying complex
00:04:14 [W] functions and also increase capacity flexibly when service demands grows why Cuban it is
00:04:22 [W] And what do we get from given at this primary networking model?
00:04:32 [W] So given that this is a cncf recommended Cloud platform.
00:04:34 [W] It provides lifecycle management scaling and Order healing service Discovery external service exposure load balancing and this is the Phi G system architecture based on 3gpp reference
00:04:47 [W] Roxas a represent different a network function that basically that's a network functions with most of them being software-based and you also see interfaces between different a network functions.
00:05:03 [W] So some of the network functions examples are a network slice selection function nsmcon.
00:05:17 [W] Also see below user equipment which is mobile laptop Etc.
00:05:23 [W] Radio Access Network use a plain function and data networks. So the highlighted area the interface is in this highlighted area are a service based interfaces.
00:05:37 [W] So basically they can be Implement using kubenetes primary networking because they are http2 or api-based so web-based interface or so they can be implemented.
00:05:47 [W] using your bananas primary networking
00:05:50 [W] The interface is highlighted in the below area are known as bi known service based interfaces.
00:05:59 [W] They are Telco interfaces over L2 L3.
00:06:05 [W] The Telco interfaces are with high requirements such as high performance low Jitter high bandwidth and not suitable for kubenetes networking example is user data plane traffic between a user equipment and
00:06:15 [W] So the highlighted area the interface is in this highlighted area are a service based interfaces.
00:06:17 [W] So basically they can be Implement using kubenetes primary networking because they are http2 or api-based so web-based interface or so. They can be implemented using human itís primary networking.
00:06:18 [W] The interface is highlighted in the below area are known as bi known service based interfaces.
00:06:19 [W] They are Telco interfaces over L2 L3.
00:06:20 [W] The Telco interfaces are with high requirements such as high performance low Jitter high bandwidth and not suitable for kubenetes networking example is user data plane traffic between a user equipment and
00:06:23 [W] Network which is mostly encapsulated in vtp protocol so for non-standard service based interfaces, we need to use secondary networks as cumin at this network cannot handle them and need different network secondary networking Solutions
00:06:31 [W] At this network cannot handle them and need different networking. Secondary networking Solutions such as Moltres or Network servicemeshcon.
00:06:34 [W] So based on all these details about why we are showing this picture in this slide is because to show how complex the architecture is and also to highlight the challenging requirements that Telco has
00:06:50 [W] So based on that, we are outlining the major challenging Telco requirements, one of them is operator requirement on end-to-end VPN separation due to security or a legacy reasons operators expect
00:07:07 [W] operation from external network till application ports with kubernative single Network model only external traffic separation is possible and no end to end VPN separation and the Second Challenge
00:07:22 [W] Support for no not protocol. So protocols that are snatched sensitive like session initiation protocol sip or media.
00:07:33 [W] And the third main challenging requirement is eager sweep for outgoing traffic originating from application ports.
00:07:48 [W] So outgoing traffic from poured the leaves cumin at this cluster with IP address of worker nodes the outgoing traffic need to come out with the virtual IP address without not reason why this is required is the IP address limit because
00:07:57 [W] use of for outgoing traffic and customer expects command IP for incoming and outgoing and another major reason requirement is support for non IP protocols and
00:08:13 [W] But not least we need to support high performance traffic that is traffic with low. Latency low Jitter High number of packets per second and high bandwidth So based on these requirements.
00:08:29 [W] There is a need to support a different traffic types.
00:08:33 [W] So here we outline different Telco traffic classes based on different ahead traffic types characteristics and packets per seconds.
00:08:39 [W] So first classification is a low performance with high functionality.
00:08:48 [W] That is a it doesn't require too much latency.
00:08:52 [W] So no latency sensitive.
00:08:55 [W] It includes protocols that supports a protocol level encryption, but it did traffic requires services like load balancers service Discovery.
00:09:03 [W] We participant each month Etc and the number of packets per second that needs to handle this like 0 to 1 million packets per second.
00:09:10 [W] And example is Operation and maintenance protocols like SNMP net convex set around and the other classification is high performance low function, which is only at the layer data link or L2 level.
00:09:24 [W] They need to handle high performance use a plane or data plane implement the normally using the pdk and cri-o a the traffic needs to handle five million packets per second and more example is used to play in function radio Access Network
00:09:38 [W] There is also a middle category that is medium performance which lies between these two categories.
00:09:48 [W] They include high performance control plane or low performance data plane and the traffic that needs to handle 125 million packets per second example is diameter sip Etc.
00:10:00 [W] Etc. So with these details and this transient will show you a visualization of when to use secondary Network in the next slide so under
00:10:08 [W] yep.
00:10:09 [W] Hello. So we said we put together a small like a decision growth on how to like how to decide when to go for a second a network.
00:10:19 [W] Of course.
00:10:24 [W] This drive is should be to always use the primary Network to be as Cloud native as possible. So we having we start with a question saying can we use a primary Network or kubernative?
00:10:30 [W] And then we say yes, and then of course we use the primary Network. So this is the easiest solution.
00:10:41 [W] If for instance that we say no we cannot use the primary Network called kubenetes.
00:10:45 [W] We think that why can we not do that?
00:10:46 [W] They must be a reason and the reason might be because of protocols.
00:10:52 [W] mean kubenetes is like supporting.
00:10:53 [W] HTTP and web protocols and stuff like that and it's is not the really good a TCP server, but we have a lot of different protocols.
00:11:06 [W] We can think about can we change the protocols of the application to instead the be web-based or something if we can do that, then we use the primary network. If you cannot change the protocols, then we can see can we update community at this
00:11:18 [W] Actually handle these kind of protocol like sctp something that has been added like quite recently. I think if you can do that, then we can use primary. If you cannot modify kubernative test, then we must use a secondary Network then there's other reasons
00:11:32 [W] For instance the operator the operator might decide that we are not allowed to use the primary Network for like the public access and that if you look at the previous slide rule sheeny we have this low
00:11:47 [W] Form of high functionality Network. I mean and that is the community Spire network will fit into that category as well.
00:11:58 [W] But sometimes we're not allowed to use it for security reasons or whatever.
00:12:04 [W] So the typical case here is that we are replacing a functionality that is already deployed at an operator and they have an architecture with the local networks already to other operators.
00:12:13 [W] So there we cannot like used shortcut all the networks that's already out there.
00:12:17 [W] Are we must be able to terminate them?
00:12:25 [W] But then we had the question. Can we try to migrate the Legacy Network architecture to a new flat network if we can do that we can use the primary. If not, we have to use the second on it.
00:12:31 [W] So the other reason would be used to perform a sport if we if we need to like switch should more than five million packets per second and with no latency.
00:12:43 [W] There is actually not much we can do and if you are latency dependent then we cannot do much. If you are a band with the pendant then we could try to like distribute the traffic over multiple workers.
00:12:56 [W] So in that case if we can like this with traffic we can use the primary aspect instead. But if you are very latency bound, we cannot do that then we have to use the second or Network.
00:13:07 [W] So so this is the sum of the reasons why we need to add and secondary Network.
00:13:16 [W] Got and then we are looking into different.
00:13:18 [W] I mean a very common very common cni-genie s exam is the multi cell bars using it.
00:13:22 [W] But we are looking into this network servicemeshcon.
00:13:27 [W] It is like a part of this cncf cncf project as well.
00:13:29 [W] Let us measure is a novel approach solving complicated L2 L3 use cases that in kubenetes R 3Q to address with the existing kubernative Network model sounds like perfect what we need actually and then we can Network
00:13:45 [W] concept of it servicemeshcon L2 and L3 payloads as portable attempt to architectural e transpose and if we in the cloud knative way to utilize Microsoft with architecture the sentence is kind of condensed, but you can
00:14:01 [W] Say that we have and networks function versus and and V and we can confirm we can convert that to Microsoft service by using MSM more.
00:14:16 [W] That's because we can model the the network services in a way that fits communities very good.
00:14:25 [W] We can use Hamish also deploy it and this kind of stuff. So I think that nsmcon will be good for doing this to break down the functionality that we have.
00:14:29 [W] And nsmcon around the distributed broker to keep track of all the resources and the set of integrated data planes to interconnect the resources in a coordinated way.
00:14:45 [W] So we as applications can actually Implement a set of services on top of nsmcon.
00:15:00 [W] So we have a defined API to implement the services and talked about recently. They like firewalls load balancers different external devices and we have defined API for an application to consumed on services.
00:15:13 [W] So there we have a demo because we have done a couple of folks with MSM and this demo.
00:15:24 [W] We'll see we show a bit later.
00:15:27 [W] I will start here with a logical view of it.
00:15:28 [W] Yeah, what we have is an application.
00:15:31 [W] Vector resources in a coordinated way, so we as applications can actually Implement a set of services on top of nsmcon.
00:15:33 [W] So we have a defined API to implement the services and talked about recently. They like firewalls load balancer different external devices and we have defined API for application to consume Adult Services.
00:15:35 [W] So there we have a demo because we have done a couple of folks within the Sam and this demo really we show a bit later.
00:15:39 [W] I will start here with the logical view of it.
00:15:39 [W] Yeah, what we have is an application.
00:15:39 [W] That's the purple box and that's a pod and then we have a controller that is a the controller is like an nsmcon troller and what it implements is a load balancing service and we have another controller that is from
00:15:44 [W] Thumb wheel on termination service.
00:15:53 [W] We have we have modified and as a bit here, so we are running with the with the Linux kernel data plane or forerunners of called nowadays.
00:15:59 [W] So they load balance is actually the ipv as the Linux kernel load was it and then we have a cross connect and we have also broken that because usually in an assembly controller and the data have there or like the same container.
00:16:13 [W] But here we use control the resources from the nsmcon.
00:16:41 [W] more physical realization of this
00:16:44 [W] so we have a kubernative cluster. We have three nodes one more stir to workers.
00:16:57 [W] We start by having like for the sitting in the worker working on our key to this. This Pond is a Distributors.
00:16:59 [W] The long termination service. We have we have modified Annabeth here. So we are running with the with the Linux kernel data plane or forerunners of called nowadays.
00:17:02 [W] So they load balance is actually the ipv as the Linux kernel load was it and then we have a cross connect and we have also broken that because usually in an assembly controller and the data have there or like the same container.
00:17:05 [W] But here we use control the resources from the nsmcon.
00:17:07 [W] more physical realization of this
00:17:07 [W] so we have a kubernative cluster. We have three nodes one more stir to workers.
00:17:09 [W] We start by having like for the sitting in the worker working on our key to this. This point is a Distributors mean is the same function is used in two places, and that's normal and that's not institution. And then we start adding stuff here. So Adam that or servicemeshcon
00:17:11 [W] Christmas for one of these for our we have modified ourselves.
00:17:13 [W] So there we add the service called the front end network service endpoint the one it's actually the controller sitting a worker to but it creates an interface on worker one that will go out to the external world next
00:17:29 [W] Other we have the load balancer network service endpoint.
00:17:33 [W] And that one will then be connected we can see here.
00:17:45 [W] So we get a packet coming because we th one which is the associated with the front end network service endpoint.
00:17:47 [W] That one will send the packet to the load balancer the load once we select one of the or in this case, it's both but we will select one at a time of course and then we have
00:17:57 [W] And then we have it we have the selected we have the I need to go back here again.
00:18:03 [W] And then I will leave the turo scheana so she can actually show that them around me.
00:18:09 [W] Thank you and - so now we will show the same setup in the live demo.
00:18:20 [W] So the external client will be called as a test machine and I have a master node and to work in oats.
00:18:31 [W] So this is the my master VM and I will show you the notes so you can see I have a master node and a tuber connotes.
00:18:41 [W] And I will show the port so when you install a network servicemeshcon will get the control plane, which is a nsmcon Ager and you get the colonel forwarder.
00:18:57 [W] Colonel forwarder or VP for water based on the available data planes and they a network servicemeshcon installed.
00:19:11 [W] So here we used a colonel forwarder. And also we did some modification to make use of a friend and friend and network service logic and this SFTP ports are my application boards.
00:19:22 [W] So I'm running an SFTP server so that I can test you.
00:19:28 [W] Being an SSH from a test machine.
00:19:35 [W] So as you see I have two ports running on two of my worker nodes and friend network service endpoint is the network service that as Anders has explained that we have designed
00:19:46 [W] And added a supply chain on top of Network servicemeshcon work which will allow us to connect Access Controller and connect to the external network.
00:20:00 [W] So load balancer networks are Reese is where we have the load balancing functionality, which will do the load balancing of the external traffic to the pack and ports. So maybe it's interesting to see the
00:20:11 [W] Network interfaces of the application vote. So when you install when you deploy an application on Cuban at this eat 0 is the default interface that you receive in my system
00:20:26 [W] Rico as a cni-genie, so this is the Calico Network and since in the application for I am requesting a network service endpoint.
00:20:41 [W] So that's why I go to an additional interface.
00:20:42 [W] That is nsmcon.
00:20:56 [W] So as usual you have the default interface and nsmcon to face that I received from the network servicemeshcon.
00:21:07 [W] This is the network interface as towards my application code and this network service interface is the one that is facing towards the external network.
00:21:17 [W] With that maybe we can try to do a testing from an external client. So this this machine is actually running outside my kubenetes cluster,
00:21:33 [W] So from Restless motion, I will try to do SSS towards my application mode. So let's try to so this is the virtual IP that I am going to use every time so by every time when I tried to do SSH
00:21:48 [W] I should get different host names.
00:21:53 [W] So here I am trying to print the host name of the application code.
00:21:56 [W] So let's try every time what is the host name that we receive? So each time when I when I when we do the sssh we can see we are getting different host names.
00:22:08 [W] So basically this is the host name of the application board.
00:22:11 [W] So this load balancing. It's still using a single Whip and the load balancing is happening behind and this is being done by the alert valence electron.
00:22:21 [W] Service, so it may be it is also interesting to see how in the application that we are requesting the network service endpoint. So in this is the deployment
00:22:33 [W] And here you can see that I have a an annotation that is appointing that is requesting to a specific network service.
00:22:47 [W] So you can Implement your own network service and can deploy it on network servicemeshcon can refer the network service in this annotation.
00:22:59 [W] So this is the only change that you have to do in the application. So if you are using voltage Network want a solution, you still get additional interfaces, but then the servicemeshcon?
00:23:04 [W] The same service Discovery and load balancing has to be handled here Network servicemeshcon Andals everything from application point of view. You just need to specify which network service you need to use
00:23:19 [W] So with that I have concluded the demo and I will stop sharing and we can go back to the slide.
00:23:28 [W] So thank you everybody. And if we have some key take away from this presentation, that would be that our old Telco Legacy cannot lie with only like the primary web interface Network.
00:23:48 [W] Suddenly the secondary afterward and we think nsmcon Way Forward because we can model the my network as Microsoft was Morgan's I think what you say machine.
00:24:02 [W] Yeah, and and application-specific Network Services can also be packaged and can be deployed on network servicemeshcon when we go to customer Cass application doesn't need to request for special
00:24:14 [W] Because that is being handled by Network servicemeshcon and also all the networking solution is handled by Network servicemeshcon.
00:24:29 [W] It's kind of a cloud native kubenetes way that application can just request for the network service and remaining logic will be handled by Network servicemeshcon.
00:24:36 [W] So with that, thank you everyone for participating in this presentation.
00:24:43 [W] So hello, everyone.
00:24:56 [W] Thank you for coming so we have got some interesting questions.
00:25:03 [W] So we will go through them.
00:25:06 [W] Should I read an - we can take the first two questions from Marco Antonio Gonzalez or teeth.
00:25:18 [W] It's about how kubernative can have that the throughput requirements and are so are we
00:25:20 [W] In for the silent requirement.
00:25:27 [W] I assume the questions are very similar to me.
00:25:31 [W] What's what they can say the communities cannot tell them that you need to have a little too sore all nsmcon something that can provide you with the user mode like networking interface.
00:25:39 [W] I think
00:25:41 [W] Thank you for viewing.
00:25:45 [W] Yeah, so basically given at this primary networking cannot handle it.
00:25:52 [W] That's why we need to have similar kind of solution.
00:25:54 [W] could be multiple choice with or nsmcon any other solution which can which needs secondary networking anything outside kubenetes networking.
00:26:02 [W] Okay, so that was the first question. Then there was a question from Sergei in shave sorry if I pronounce it wrong has
00:26:19 [W] being added to kubernative cni-genie
00:26:48 [W] and there was another question. Will you use vxlan for Phi G C and F sore vlans?
00:26:56 [W] So what do you think? It's a seventh question and what we showed here is the pork on the I mean and our find the implementations today.
00:27:12 [W] I think to use moon to send vlans most of them and this is what we are looking into my to like him.
00:27:16 [W] to make this more model driven and in our book that we show the demo version show we use V loans for external connection, but internally, nsmcon VX Lawns forever full different streams
00:27:31 [W] Yeah, yeah, so that's at least what I'm a I think that our current implementation in five uses very long, but most is that he laughing.
00:27:43 [W] Do you have any other information Rafi?
00:27:49 [W] No, I agree what you said so we can take the next one.
00:27:56 [W] Why was maltose note in a for this use case?
00:28:01 [W] So this is what we summarized in our key takeaways that when we have to base our Solution on multis, then the services like load balancing
00:28:11 [W] Ri-ight Pam and so on I wish is handled by kubernative networking by itself has to be implemented as a separate services and it has to be bundled with the application and you have to carry that in different.
00:28:27 [W] deployment environments and some might require special privileges and so on but when we are using network servicemeshcon
00:28:57 [W] Cncf kind of way.
00:29:01 [W] So this is why we think nsmcon be like a potential solution for secondary networking and having said that obviously if you're going to a customer cars and if nsmcon stalled
00:29:15 [W] and from view from like an application doesn't require any special privileges because that has been already been carried or taken care understood you have anything more to add
00:29:31 [W] Understood you have anything more to add the same as you say but I think that you can say it's very easy moon to see sexually giving you an interface into the home. And with that you can do like every you can do anything in the world with it, but everything
00:29:41 [W] In the world will be but everything will be an ad hoc solution with an assembly see that the possible way to like make it model River and have like a standard weight.
00:29:50 [W] So, okay.
00:29:58 [W] So next question is are you using Calico without IP IP in your demo? Is this running on bare metal with bgp?
00:30:08 [W] This is a question from a Dell the look. So in in our demo we have been focusing on the secondary networking and of course our primary.
00:30:20 [W] King is using Calico of it IP IP and this is run on VM missions.
00:30:35 [W] So with bgp, of course, but our Focus was mostly on the secondary networking. That means a network other than the Cuban artists Calico Network.
00:30:44 [W] And if you have anything to add you have your sister.
00:30:45 [W] There is another question from Francisco castelo easy demo code available.
00:30:59 [W] Or maybe we want to do this because the main thing here is actually the breakout of the front and pork, isn't it?
00:31:24 [W] and what nginx anybody in the forward and what we need to do is to use the new nsmcon Q texture to make our own forward and that we could probably make available but these code if we make it available it has to be made
00:31:37 [W] It's on the side all that of the understand standard repo because it will work together with it.
00:31:44 [W] Do you understand that I mean, we have we have messed up then there's a reason the cold.
00:31:55 [W] Yep.
00:31:59 [W] Shall we go to the next question?
00:32:02 [W] Okay.
00:32:06 [W] It's a question from Killian Muldoon.
00:32:09 [W] better overall solution at scale than multi spaced solution. So the question is about scalability.
00:32:15 [W] M-move took does it scale?
00:32:20 [W] It's just gives you an interface per node. So actually if I say you have a little too solution.
00:32:24 [W] I don't know how that's case.
00:32:26 [W] I mean it depends you will put cables into the switch, but how it's working at all. I can't say.
00:32:32 [W] And this is the problem with move because I think I'm going to say is you just like a way into the fold.
00:32:38 [W] It doesn't say anything of their overall architecture.
00:32:40 [W] What do you say oshin?
00:32:43 [W] Yeah, so I mean if you want to get an additional interface, you can use maltose with additional cni-genie, but then there are much more that we need to handle like the services that will
00:32:57 [W] Needed yeah, this is the thing.
00:33:01 [W] Yeah, exactly.
00:33:12 [W] So once you got an extra interface, that won't be enough you have to do bit more. Then that has to be handled within your application code which is like a bit.
00:33:17 [W] I mean it's bit more work per each application then each application have to do individually and that will be again with different and and here from nsmcon of your from
00:33:30 [W] Need to request for in service in their manifest like in their deployment manifest. They just need to add an annotation as we have shown in the demo to explain like I need
00:33:46 [W] That will handle load balancing or whatever then the rest everything the connection and everything is handling Candle by nsmcon.
00:34:16 [W] Service Discovery mechanism.
00:34:20 [W] It's handled by kubernative.
00:34:23 [W] So this is something similar that will be done with an nsmcon.
00:34:27 [W] It's a framework where you can add a network Services as a plugins. So which kind of Network Services you want that is up to you to write and so yeah, so for in our example, we have shown like load balancer as
00:34:40 [W] Something similar that will be done with the nsmcon. It's a framework where you can add a network Services as a plugins. So which kind of Network Services you want that is up to you to write and
00:34:41 [W] And friend Anderson network service.
00:34:45 [W] I think I talk too much.
00:34:48 [W] You should go to next question.
00:34:52 [W] Do you say it's a question from adriaen bra under do you see?
00:35:00 [W] Okay.
00:35:00 [W] Sorry.
00:35:05 [W] I am coming challenges of points that require local Affinity. You too late. There's a limitation. I mean it does we have the petabyte-scale.
00:35:10 [W] feeling like everybody there's no way wrong is I don't know I mean
00:35:14 [W] I have seen because we had we have come so far yet has seen something where you're keeping it this way. You can put that you require number CPUs and you to put a limit the same as the amount you have or something then you would Maurice
00:35:30 [W] Scene because we are not comfortable for you at the scene something well in keeping it this way you can put that you require number CPUs and you to put a limit the same as the amount you have or something then you would Maurice
00:35:33 [W] Fix every cgroup something but we need to have that. We need to have the process standing on the core the top of Encore and the same comes to scaling of the for running play.
00:35:46 [W] I don't know that it has to be done with application in mind and we need to find some way of dividing it into sessions for something like this. We cannot just split the stream up.
00:35:52 [W] I don't know if that's a good answer.
00:35:57 [W] Do you know what we're seeing?
00:35:57 [W] Yeah, I think I have the same answer as well.
00:36:03 [W] But if you have more questions we can get clarified in this election or later.
00:36:10 [W] So we will be available for 15 more minutes after the time is over. So next question from Adrian Brown under do you see a need for even more networks or does secondary means just any other kind of network except the primary
00:36:21 [W] That you see ya. So as you understood right?
00:36:29 [W] it's anynines work other than primary networking. So it could be one or more or five second half Rook is it is your second are from kubernative sense. Maybe the terminology used to strong. But
00:36:42 [W] So we call the second tray.
00:36:45 [W] Yeah, another significant natural Korean recommendable second half
00:36:53 [W] Yeah, we are we are looking at and the same and it's not a seeing eye dog. But if you want to have an cni-genie.
00:37:16 [W] To get the user mode the PCI useful.
00:37:22 [W] Do you know that VFR you something?
00:37:27 [W] Usually we go everyone knows that the future that kind of business.
00:37:35 [W] Okay, so next question from a duel - Pandy.
00:37:50 [W] Are you exposing the cluster node outside world with the public IP in this architecture when external fly and is connecting to El bien SE.
00:37:52 [W] So it was a vpat rest virtual IP that routable virtual IP.
00:37:58 [W] This is what we were exposing in the demo and the external client was trying to connect to the Veep. So that's why even though
00:38:06 [W] To either of them are using the same Vape. So that was the concept that we used under sure.
00:38:20 [W] Do you have anything more to add?
00:38:23 [W] Well, this is so with all these different.
00:38:28 [W] I mean you can use you can put the public IP on the load balancer and then you use Nats to get into the system sometimes in Arizona.
00:38:35 [W] We actually use that the server it alone.
00:38:39 [W] we use the lip butter is only action clients as well.
00:38:41 [W] So you don't you don't have any nap in that dress?
00:38:46 [W] I don't know if this case I think is enough. Isn't it dream big salt?
00:38:52 [W] Yeah, you have exalted what we run and
00:39:06 [W] next question
00:39:08 [W] some team say nsmcon ready for five Decor Is it feasible that we deploy your code without nsmcon evolve? Is it possible?
00:39:18 [W] Yeah, so these Network Services that we have mentioned a has to be developed and designed with Telco grade.
00:39:27 [W] Yeah quality and this is something that has to be initiated and and of course it is possible to evolve from any other solution to nsmcon.
00:39:39 [W] I mentioned you just need to have the annotations in your application where you mention which network service that has to be selected, but then the is network service needs to be
00:39:54 [W] and they're in the nsmcon deployed in the end result is this is something that has to be worked on and yes, it is fixable that you could able and if you have any other opinion
00:40:10 [W] if your fees will do that. Yeah, I would say that exactly.
00:40:17 [W] Yep.
00:40:23 [W] Reading number 21.
00:40:31 [W] No, I am trying to maximize my screen.
00:40:32 [W] Can you read about and if we aren't standards when it comes to nsmcon this new model?
00:40:41 [W] I don't know that really because any be any standard is more or less. Just we have we use nsmcon like Implement something then what packet comes in and out of the protocol and as I mean
00:40:53 [W] that's of course must be part of the standard is you
00:40:57 [W] maybe you need to mention who has asked what?
00:41:05 [W] Vijay come up. Okay.
00:41:11 [W] Yeah, maybe.
00:41:15 [W] Okay. So next is from Francisco Castle.
00:41:35 [W] Oh can this be applied in hosted Cuban at this like Google cloud or Amazon eks.
00:41:45 [W] Yes.
00:41:46 [W] I'm an I in in NS Community. They have been doing testing with these public clouds as well. As far as my understanding is right under.
00:41:56 [W] What do you say this?
00:42:04 [W] I mean in community they are doing testing on public clouds as well.
00:42:06 [W] Yeah still needs to be like Services needs to be a priority or subsidies Elementary be maybe what we would like to see is that all the
00:42:21 [W] I just really need all like starter components.
00:42:24 [W] so they could be like installed in all this environment and and
00:42:29 [W] and be approved by the operators or the owners of the platform money because I don't think that they will let us come and put it over. I think that in the data plane ourselves.
00:42:45 [W] Okay, so we are now five minutes past the Q and A lot of time, but we will be available on slack to cube core networking to continue question answers.
00:42:56 [W] We got a lot of questions which we couldn't answer in this short time.
00:43:01 [W] But thank you everyone I once again for attending this session and we will be available for 15 more minutes in the cube core networking slack Channel.
00:43:10 [W] And if you want to say something.
