00:05:10 [W] Welcome, how do you define Cloud native networking?
00:09:23 [W] For you, is that a collection of projects?
00:09:27 [W] Is that particular Technologies container networking virtual networking software defined networking intent-based networking servicemeshcon?
00:09:38 [W] Well, these are concerns that we try to address and help uplift and clarify inside of the cncf Sig Network.
00:09:46 [W] We work closely with all of the network related projects that are within the cncf.
00:09:53 [W] Sig network was formed not too long ago.
00:10:02 [W] It was about a little over a Cubed on ago. If you will we were formed with a particular mission.
00:10:05 [W] And that is to help people do Cloud native networking and do it.
00:10:11 [W] inside of the cncf Sig Network
00:10:24 [W] We work closely with all of the network related projects that are within the cncf.
00:10:25 [W] Sig network was formed not too long ago.
00:10:26 [W] It was about a little over a Cubed on ago. If you will we were formed with a particular mission.
00:10:26 [W] And that is to help people do Cloud native networking and do it.
00:10:27 [W] Well, we do that by
00:10:27 [W] Trying to help projects collaborate and interrelate to one another by seeking to clarify and inform in general we aim to assist our existing projects and attract new ones
00:10:29 [W] We aim to assist our existing projects and attract new ones provide people a venue for vendor-neutral discussion and kind of advancing of thought in the space of capabilities in the space.
00:10:40 [W] That our chairs of the cncf Sig Network Matt Klein of lift.
00:10:48 [W] I'm Lee Cal coat of layer 5 and Ken Owens of MasterCard.
00:10:51 [W] Last time that we addressed you was Cube Con San Diego Cube con North America 2019 at the time. We represented cni-genie.
00:11:23 [W] For which are at a Sandbox level and one of which is an incubation level.
00:11:30 [W] level. So BFE cni-genie Contours at an incubation level Kuma and servicemeshcon her face.
00:11:37 [W] We've been busy.
00:11:43 [W] There are more projects on the horizon, including some that are under active review.
00:11:48 [W] So Ambassador chaosmesh measure e and the servicemeshcon formance specification.
00:11:56 [W] Which was fairly recent addition at the time and since then we've been fortunate enough to bring in five more projects for which are at a Sandbox level and one of which is an incubation level.
00:12:11 [W] The UDP a working group or the universal data plane API working group servicemeshcon group.
00:12:22 [W] We also are well actively considering trying to help inform in general and might do so through some white papers.
00:12:29 [W] papers. There's one that's been written and is referred to as the cloud native networking principles. These are being proposed for incorporation into Sig Network.
00:12:37 [W] There are also any number of patterns and reference architectures that are likely to come out of some work that's being done inside of the servicemeshcon group.
00:12:48 [W] The Sig Network also entertains presentations in general that are relevant to the space and have received one or two of those.
00:13:02 [W] There was an interesting one given not too long ago that you see linked here. You'll find those and each of these links inside of what is it github.com / cncf / Sig Network.
00:13:14 [W] So there's a lot that gets done inside of this group and more that we're hoping to get done and actually some of what we've got planned for between now and next q Khan, we'd really like
00:13:30 [W] Long ago that you see linked here, you'll find those and each of these links inside of what is it github.com / cncf / Sig Network.
00:13:32 [W] So there's a lot that gets done inside of this group and more that we're hoping to get done and actually some of what we've got planned for between now and next Cube
00:13:33 [W] Just your input but your participation like for you to bring up topics and meaningfully impact our Focus.
00:13:40 [W] The calls that we have our twice a month all are welcome, whether you're you know, your organization or you specifically are a member of the cncf, but just so long as you've got interest in the space Please join read through the meeting
00:13:55 [W] Public right now and determine whether or not the topics that we have currently are of interest if they're not please suggest new ones. So
00:14:07 [W] Want to take the rest of the time that we have together to review some of the initiatives we have any number of those five new projects which are all unto their own exciting.
00:14:23 [W] We also have the servicemeshcon working group that is advancing a few different initiatives that I'd like to highlight and introduce to you if you're unfamiliar with these
00:14:34 [W] Now some of these initiatives that we have our have some common goals part of seeking to clarify and inform in general means that we will put to use the cncf labs cncf cluster.
00:14:50 [W] You if you're unfamiliar with these now some of these initiatives that we have are have some common goals.
00:14:51 [W] Part of seeking to clarify and inform in general means that we will put to use the cncf labs cncf cluster.
00:14:55 [W] It's generally available to projects to those that are looking to do generally like at scale testing to run on some hardware and quite a few pieces of Hardware that aren't always
00:15:05 [W] generally like at scale testing to run on some hardware and quite a few pieces of Hardware that aren't always available to these open source projects and so performance testing is commonly done here or
00:15:12 [W] news about resiliency and haproxy
00:15:42 [W] here are executed in the servicemeshcon Locking group.
00:15:49 [W] And so hands a very servicemeshcon Centric Focus these abstractions have Arisen because it is a multi meshmark that we live in today and that we see users and organizations deploying a variety of meshes for
00:16:04 [W] Different use cases you have different tools for different jobs and so different servicemeshcon for different jobs because of that.
00:16:17 [W] We've we see some abstractions some apis that work across servicemeshcon or just help abstract away. The particular is of a given meshmark.
00:16:28 [W] The first one we'll talk about is servicemeshcon interface or SMI.
00:16:35 [W] It's a standard interface for interacting with or adopting and using operating any given servicemeshcon implements the spec.
00:16:46 [W] Another abstraction other specification that's coming forth is the servicemeshcon format specification or SPS.
00:17:00 [W] It's a standard for describing in capturing the performance of a servicemeshcon.
00:17:01 [W] The next one that has been in the ecosystem for a little while and we're just starting to address with inside. The the servicemeshcon group is Hamlet or the multi-vendor servicemeshcon.
00:17:18 [W] This is well complement while they're all complimentary. But this is a set of apis that enable service catalog Federation or Federation of services
00:17:33 [W] one servicemeshcon
00:17:45 [W] so much going on by the way of specifications and standard apis all of the first specification SMI as any servicemeshcon immense against that
00:18:01 [W] Qualification whether or not the that project has done. So in accordance with the specification needs to be performed.
00:18:13 [W] So to validate that that implementation conforms to SMI specs are about 4S my specs today.
00:18:19 [W] and so of the initiatives that were speaking about this first one it's being done in coordination with Community bridge and which is a Linux Foundation project that
00:18:35 [W] first one is being done in coordination with Community bridge and which is a Linux Foundation project that well does a few different things but but one of them is helps out
00:18:39 [W] Things but but one of them is helps out cncf projects like SMI, and so the purpose of there's a tool being built and the purpose of it is to provide an easy
00:18:51 [W] New tool that allows you to repeatably verify whether or not a servicemeshcon in compliance with SMI specifications.
00:19:03 [W] And so this this tool is intended to be used by not only SMI as a project but also by each of the individual servicemeshcon are implementing a semi so that they can in an ongoing way validate their conformance.
00:19:18 [W] It's also available to end users or to those that are adopting servicemeshcon spur them to perform similar validations.
00:19:26 [W] The tool does generate a report and runs any it asserts any number of tests and that report then is yet to be published publicly.
00:19:42 [W] But as the tool gets towards its final phases that's part of the goal in order to validate conformance and in order to do so.
00:19:54 [W] In well in order to do so servicemeshcon needs to be deployed a workloads needs to be deployed a sample workloads mesh and then it's interfaces. The SMI interface is need to be exercised
00:20:10 [W] Tool performs those things in this case.
00:20:17 [W] This is measure e the servicemeshcon Judgment plane is working in conjunction with SMI and its specifications deploying a sample app called learn layer 5, which
00:20:29 [W] My and its specifications deploying a sample app called learn layer 5 which really works as two different things at works as a sample app for conformance testing with SMI.
00:20:38 [W] SMI. It also works as a sample app in general for learning how servicemeshcon work.
00:20:43 [W] So if you're interested in knowing more about that project, there's a few different links on the page.
00:20:51 [W] Each one will get you to that project or you can just go to the SMI Community meetings Chapman every every couple weeks.
00:20:58 [W] This next specification is the servicemeshcon format specification or smps.
00:21:08 [W] It's a vendor neutral performance standard for measuring how well a given measures implementation is is running and actually answering that
00:21:21 [W] Format specification or smps?
00:21:22 [W] It's a vendor neutral performance standard for measuring how well a given measures implementation is is running and actually answering that and
00:21:23 [W] And you kind of describing it accurately and completely holistically fairly challenging. There are a myriad number of variables included in you know in ascertaining.
00:21:37 [W] Performance of a given message is that's highly dependent upon what the environment is like that it's deployed in how many nodes there are how many clusters what the size of them are what resources they have available.
00:21:53 [W] What very what measure you have deployed what version of the mess you've deployed what workloads are running on the mesh what the mesh is configured to do.
00:21:59 [W] The more that is asked of it the more it costs to run it costs kind of with with quotes this particular specification and describes a standard way of capturing those
00:22:14 [W] So we just mentioned and also prefer providing a standard way of reporting a statistical analysis of load has been generated against the services running on a mesh.
00:22:29 [W] and and the reporting of those stats, so
00:22:34 [W] there's a well sort of there's a fair bit to this.
00:22:46 [W] It does directly do the things that we just mentioned and it is, you know, a standard way of doing that.
00:22:47 [W] It does then, you know kind of on top of this spec facilitates a few different things, you know, arguably most importantly it facilitates end users having a common way to Baseline their
00:23:01 [W] Mark the performance of their Mash as they've initially deployed it as it's running into the particular, you know setup then over time as that environment changes as their configuration of the messages as their workloads change that they're able to use this
00:23:16 [W] The standard spectro measure servicemeshcon formance again. And again, it facilitates then potentially comparing one deployment to the next and having facilitates also having a performance index
00:23:32 [W] unit of measure to say to identify him how well you know how well a given servicemeshcon performing so
00:23:42 [W] I guess to give a further example of that this
00:23:50 [W] Isn't included in the spec but is the performance index that I was just mentioning?
00:23:59 [W] There is one that's coming around.
00:24:00 [W] It's called meshmark it is.
00:24:02 [W] That simple index that I was just referring to it. So it's a very simple way of quickly articulating the performance of a servicemeshcon text of the value that is providing. If you're asking the mesh to do a lot invoke a number of you know
00:24:18 [W] bent rules if you're asking it to encrypt things traffic and east and west well that affects the performance of a mash the more that you ask you to do, you know, generally
00:24:34 [W] And always the case but it depends on your deployment and your environment. Generally you would expect that.
00:24:45 [W] You have to quote unquote pay more for that. And so meshmark is an easy way of it's a way of providing a unit of value so that you can speak to how well a mesh is running.
00:24:56 [W] maybe yours is running a meshmark of 90. Maybe there's a similar deployment that's running meshmark of 85 maybe lesser, right?
00:25:05 [W] The the examples that I'm giving here are just random examples the unit of scale is still to be hardened and and completely defined but the point is maybe between these two different environments. You've got
00:25:19 [W] Examples the unit of scale is still to be hardened and and completely defined but the point is maybe between these two different environments. You've got really the same servicemeshcon environment in terms of
00:25:23 [W] Servicemeshcon environment in terms of nodes and their resources.
00:25:27 [W] Maybe you're asking one to do more than the next and many of us that are running servicemeshcon.
00:25:34 [W] don't necessarily have an easy way to gauge whether or not we're deriving, you know, the value that we're paying for in that the overhead of the mesh is in fact worth the what we're getting out of it.
00:25:47 [W] Certainly, is that case?
00:25:53 [W] But it's really hard to articulate and compare and understand and reason over whether or not you've got your servicemeshcon tuned in the right way.
00:25:59 [W] The next project is well also being done with through the another internship program called Google Google summer of code.
00:26:12 [W] This one has to do with really a recognition of the fact that
00:26:20 [W] We are well many of us are running, you know, essentially distributed systems running microservices and potentially plenty of them.
00:26:30 [W] The analysis that you'll often see about understanding the performance and kind of the be the behavioral characteristics in terms of performance of a given set of microservices is usually done from sort of a single instance of
00:26:46 [W] Hello generator, excuse me.
00:26:56 [W] So you might generate load against in one load generator oftentimes a closed-loop load generator might be creating a bunch of HTTP traffic pointed at a particular end point.
00:27:03 [W] pointed at a particular service
00:27:06 [W] And that's providing you can analyze the behavior of those Services. You can analyze their response time their latency the throughput that they receive.
00:27:17 [W] But that's maybe missing part of the point of the fact that we are running we collectively are running distributed systems. And so shouldn't our performance analysis. Also be distributed shouldn't we also have
00:27:34 [W] Maybe missing part of the point of the fact that we are running we collectively are running distributed systems.
00:27:35 [W] And so shouldn't our performance analysis. Also be distributed shouldn't we also have multiple instances of load generators hitting various and points of your different microservices.
00:27:43 [W] You're welcome micro or not, but hitting different, you know endpoints of your services and then doing analysis of each of those loads that were generated.
00:27:50 [W] Rated how they responded coalescing those results.
00:27:55 [W] So there's an ongoing project now that's working with the Nighthawk load generator of the envoy project and pulling that and do it using that its capabilities enhancing its capabilities
00:28:08 [W] Text with the servicemeshcon Judgment plane Mastery which already supports two other types of load generators W RK 2 and 4 TL and and also supports Nighthawk now, but will support it in a
00:28:24 [W] So an interesting project we're expecting some some novel results. So
00:28:33 [W] with that I'll make another call for participation and say these are open projects. If you find that those are of Interest those are sampling of initiatives that are taking place in
00:28:50 [W] The servicemeshcon group inside of Sig Network Sig Network itself is much bigger in scope than those four projects at those four initiatives.
00:29:04 [W] I should say and part of that is the scope around all of the other member projects, which we talked about at the beginning of the call.
00:29:15 [W] So all kinds of things going on all kinds of things to get involved with and you're very much so encouraged to if you have
00:29:21 [W] ins I will be in the QA likely joined with the other Sig Network chairs.
00:29:29 [W] Please bring your questions, please show up for a meeting and suggest a new topic.
00:29:35 [W] All right.
00:29:35 [W] we'll see you soon.
00:29:36 [W] Hello.
00:29:47 [W] All right.
00:29:56 [W] Well, I think that we're live.
00:29:57 [W] We're live.
00:30:06 [W] Okay, good.
00:30:07 [W] Well hello.
00:30:09 [W] Good afternoon.
00:30:10 [W] Good morning.
00:30:12 [W] Well, good good to see. All right. Okay.
00:30:19 [W] Geez, we've got questions slowing in now.
00:30:20 [W] All right.
00:30:21 [W] Well, I think that we're live.
00:30:21 [W] We're live.
00:30:21 [W] Okay, good.
00:30:21 [W] Well hello.
00:30:22 [W] Good afternoon.
00:30:22 [W] Good morning.
00:30:22 [W] Well, good good to see. All right. Okay.
00:30:22 [W] Geez, we've got questions flowing in now.
00:30:22 [W] I don't know.
00:30:26 [W] What's worse trying to give a talk live or having to be forced to listen to yourself.
00:30:30 [W] All right, a couple of questions coming through off the top what prevents cheating in performance testing great question.
00:30:43 [W] So while the question is stated somewhat generally, maybe I'll respond sort of in context of the
00:30:50 [W] I can well both I guess the SMI conformance testing that we were speaking of as well as just SMP the servicemeshcon formance specification.
00:31:06 [W] So first in terms of SMI conformance and validating the conformance to of Any Given servicemeshcon SMI specifications, it's
00:31:18 [W] My specifications it's it is pretty important that those tests and the results of those tests that the provenance of those are guaranteed such that the and so what happens there
00:31:29 [W] an inch is that measure e is a tool that each of the servicemeshcon are implementing SMI take and run those conformance test when they do they'll log in
00:31:46 [W] A specific account will be assigned to them they'll log in use that account. They'll run the tests. Once the tests are run.
00:32:00 [W] It's still possible for them to manipulate the test results.
00:32:01 [W] It's an open source project in the tests are open source, and so conceptually they could take you know clone and build a new binary that passes all of their tests.
00:32:15 [W] to circumvent that the each
00:32:18 [W] That the official build for the open source project that Mastery that tests SMI conformance.
00:32:27 [W] It has a secret key built-in that's injected in build time of the binary.
00:32:35 [W] So not only does that build need to be an official one of the tool itself. But then also they need to be using their assigned account and so sort of the accuracy and the Providence of SMI conformance tests can be confirmed in
00:32:45 [W] So to circumvent that the deal each time that the official build for the open source project that Mastery that tests SMI conformance.
00:32:46 [W] It has a secret key built-in that's injected in build time of the binary.
00:32:47 [W] So not only does that build need to be an official one of the tool itself. But then also they need to be using their assigned account and so sort of the
00:32:48 [W] In the Providence of SMI conformance tests can be confirmed in that way.
00:32:49 [W] So maybe that's kind of one one way. The other way is that in part what was being asked is like a how can you how can you what prevents cheating and performance testing? So with respect to S MP?
00:33:00 [W] So maybe that's kind of one one way.
00:33:02 [W] one way. The other way is that in part what was being asked is like a how can you how can you what prevents cheating and performance testing? So with respect to S MP servicemeshcon formance spec?
00:33:04 [W] Yeah, so I'll say that the group that's working on that specification has yet to has yet to excuse me really conclude on on the mechanics by
00:33:20 [W] um on the mechanics by which the specification will outline, you know how to prevent that in essence given that it is a spec and not
00:33:31 [W] capability
00:33:35 [W] the spec will likely if I can foreshadow here will likely implement or require a similar implementation to guarantee test results that they're clean.
00:33:49 [W] There is a canonical implementation of that spec it is that tool measure e which does prevent meddling with test results in the way in which we just spoke.
00:34:03 [W] I'm the spec itself doesn't require that just yet.
00:34:09 [W] So good question.
00:34:10 [W] Very good.
00:34:13 [W] OK next question.
00:34:16 [W] What makes Hamlet called Hamlet so well, so I'll say this that while I can't I will cautiously speak on behalf of the project.
00:34:28 [W] So just having spent a lot of time with the the creators of that project Hamlet.
00:34:38 [W] Having asked a similar question.
00:34:46 [W] My understanding is that that like any large organization have this having originated within VMware that a they want to have something of a unique project name
00:34:55 [W] On behalf of the project.
00:34:56 [W] So just having spent a lot of time with the the creators of that project Hamlet, you know having asked a similar question my understanding is that
00:34:57 [W] Naming is hard see doing a large organization is no doubt has its challenges with respect to Legal teams.
00:35:07 [W] Initially.
00:35:10 [W] I think that was the internal project name from what I understand and and when it was initially announced in a blog post on vmware.com that I don't know that that project name that internal project name was used
00:35:22 [W] I think it took some time for that to finally come out beyond that.
00:35:38 [W] I'll have to catch me in the slack and I will point you to the people behind the scenes on Hamlet so you can get a better.
00:35:41 [W] better backstory
00:35:44 [W] great. So next question is sorry how to get involved in Sig Network and how to convince management that we need to spend time on great questions.
00:36:00 [W] So the first one is an easy answer which is there's a few different ways to get involved in Sig Network.
00:36:06 [W] So one is that within the cncf slack that hopefully you are all in as we speak. There's a channel Sig - Network
00:36:11 [W] All are welcome, please drop in that's a great way to get connected instead of sort of see what's going on.
00:36:21 [W] There is a bi-monthly or a once every two weeks meeting in which much of the things that we were just talking about.
00:36:30 [W] Our disgust projects are reviewed all are welcome. Whether you're a member of whether your organization is a member of the cncf or not.
00:36:39 [W] So it's an open call, please jump in participation.
00:36:41 [W] Very much encouraged in that way lastly.
00:36:45 [W] You're not able to join during the meeting times.
00:36:56 [W] And then with respect to the second question about how to convince management to spend time on it. I've got to say
00:37:05 [W] I think I've both failed and succeeded in answering that same question different organizations.
00:37:14 [W] I've been at been at Cisco at Seagate large Tech organizations small Tech organizations.
00:37:20 [W] I think part of it comes down to whether or not the business itself is
00:37:29 [W] forward leaning or fairly comfortable where they're at, which is to say if they're sort of comfortable to kind of wait for letting others figure out sort of what what the answer is or what the next steps are for how
00:37:45 [W] Some in this in context of this space.
00:37:48 [W] It could be a harder.
00:37:52 [W] harder conversation think if if even if the company doesn't necessarily want to be in the position of being influential in the industry that still just being a prized of where things are headed
00:38:08 [W] Helpful being able to engage with other world class Architects and engineers and other users of the technology both the creators and the users really strong reasons to come and spend an hour or two
00:38:25 [W] Strong reasons to come and spend an hour or two also to help build their employees help retain their employees help make it their employees.
00:38:32 [W] happy and smart.
00:38:40 [W] That sounds I know that sounds like good things for a company to do and it's my belief that yeah spending a little bit of time whether it's in Sig Network or just in the cncf in general.
00:38:45 [W] The sort of hard to go wrong in that way. So
00:38:50 [W] Good looking for other questions in case you have them to the last question.
00:39:04 [W] I was going to re-emphasize that call for participation in no small part is our the topics that we cover in the agendas that we have influenced by you directly. Yes you
00:39:15 [W] Those agendas are represented by service providers Architects and Engineers that will show up from service providers by Enterprises people that just show up to participate.
00:39:30 [W] It's really a really is about who shows up and and who wants to roll up their sleeves a little bit lots of things to get involved in by the way in some respects.
00:39:42 [W] We only have so much to speak about because there are only so many people involved really like
00:39:47 [W] limit based on who's spending the time, so
00:40:00 [W] very good
00:40:07 [W] We don't have other questions at the moment.
00:40:12 [W] I get the sense that I'm going to get the hook here any moment.
00:40:16 [W] But my timing could be off.
00:40:19 [W] I'll pause for a minute wait for a couple of other questions to come in just in case if if anyone doesn't have any or a rather if you think of them later, I'll be hanging out in the maintainers slack or in the in that channel.
00:40:34 [W] And happy to talk to you.
00:40:39 [W] About sto or any other servicemeshcon any of the projects that are represented in the group.
00:40:50 [W] I've had lots of participation from the good folks representing the Nats project lots of participation from the Telecom User Group.
00:41:02 [W] The Telecom user group is actually soliciting feedback right now on what's essentially an online white paper that is linked inside. The slides. The slides are actually linked to should be downloadable. I think right right here, so
00:41:10 [W] Hopefully the hyperlinks work when you download.
00:41:12 [W] Did have another question role in one of those is just the questions just unsure of how to get started within the network Within.
00:41:23 [W] It's within networking at large and but to the extent that it's specific to like the cncf Sig Network.
00:41:35 [W] Actually, I guess the answer is sort of both whether it's networking at large or specifically just the cncf Sig Network group.
00:41:43 [W] Come to the group and and I'll make sure that you get connected in the right ways.
00:41:52 [W] Maybe you're studying for your CCNA.
00:41:54 [W] Mine was a really long time ago or your or you know, maybe you're studying just, you know, pure network engineering.
00:42:01 [W] maybe you're studying sort of the sdn and sort of next-gen sdn. If you will part of my role in the time that I spend here is to help others in just that way. So
00:42:14 [W] Very happy to do it.
00:42:15 [W] And then kind of a follow-up question is just whether or not there's any good repositories to look at too.
00:42:29 [W] So, I guess there may be given that it's such a kind of a broad broad space.
00:42:32 [W] Maybe I'd say there is cncf repository.
00:42:34 [W] It's github.com cncf, let me
00:42:39 [W] Maybe post that / cncf.
00:42:43 [W] All be pretty warm and welcoming.
00:42:58 [W] And actually I would say if they're not I'd be interested to know which ones are not which ones are not engaging people. So.
00:43:09 [W] fair enough
00:43:14 [W] Okay, great.
00:43:16 [W] I think we're we got one more quick one one minute left.
00:43:29 [W] And so the question is, you know, you've mentioned several standards related to servicemeshcon our faces and performance.
00:43:34 [W] are those are there sdos with which you work to produce those and and sdos I'm racking my brain is either like an isv a software development organizations.
00:43:44 [W] Probably what that is.
00:43:45 [W] I'm for a standards body.
00:43:50 [W] Perhaps maybe that's what the S stands for the cncf itself isn't just with respect to that word standards. Isn't it? Depends on what you consider? A standard cncf itself isn't
00:44:03 [W] Standards organization to extent that you think of the IEEE or the like or the DMT F. What have you that said?
00:44:17 [W] There's been any number of specifications that may as well be standards to the extent that that standard is measured by its adoption.
00:44:24 [W] The implementation of the definition of those are broadly open like I like hey the answer is anyone with that wants to participate is is welcome to that has comments and wants to help
00:44:32 [W] So so we are at time if that didn't answer the questions, please drop in to the channel and we'll continue from there.
00:44:42 [W] So thanks so much.
00:44:43 [W] We'll see you all soon.
