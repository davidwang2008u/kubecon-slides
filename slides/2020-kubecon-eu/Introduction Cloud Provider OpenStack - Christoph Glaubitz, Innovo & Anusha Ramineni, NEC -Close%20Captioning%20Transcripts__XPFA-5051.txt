00:01:24 [W] Hello, good afternoon, everyone.
00:01:33 [W] So today I am here to provide an update and introduction on cloud provider openstack project.
00:01:38 [W] So little bit about myself I minutiae currently working as an upstream developer at NEC and also serving as a co-lead for provider openstack project. So you can find me at the rate Romany on
00:01:54 [W] So today's agenda so we'll go through the overview of the project.
00:02:06 [W] Then the water plugins that are hosted as part of the project and then we'll go to the CSI drivers that are supported and what all supported what's new that has been added for the past few releases and the
00:02:18 [W] Ancient and last but not the least how to get involved with the project.
00:02:23 [W] So what is cloud provider openstack so Cloud providers use to leverage underlying cloud services?
00:02:40 [W] So if you have a openstack cloud and kubernative S on top of it now provider openstack enables kubernative to talk to underlying openstack apis to leverage various its services.
00:02:51 [W] So basically it acts as an interface between the host open style openstack cloud and the kubernative.
00:02:57 [W] Yes, so if you look at the diagram so cloud provider openstack integrates with the kubernative with a by implementing its cloud provider interface and in turn provide openstack talks to the openstack apis
00:03:12 [W] Now provided openstack any bubbles kubernative to talk to underlying openstack apis to leverage various its services.
00:03:14 [W] So basically it acts as an interface between the host open style openstack cloud and the kubernative.
00:03:15 [W] So if you look at the diagram so cloud provider openstack integrates with the kubernative with a by implementing its cloud provider interface and in turn provide opentracing
00:03:16 [W] that talks to the openstack apis to get various other information.
00:03:17 [W] From the code organization perspective.
00:03:21 [W] It is part of Sig cloud provider and it's and implementation of the out of three provider.
00:03:26 [W] So we'll go through in a bed or t what exactly is out of tree provider.
00:03:31 [W] Entry versus out of free little bit of background so entry what's actually an entry provider so previously all the cloud providers or shipped with the kubernative main kubernative binaries. So
00:03:50 [W] the information
00:03:50 [W] from the code organization perspective.
00:03:51 [W] It is part of Sig cloud provider and it's and implementation of the out of three provider.
00:03:51 [W] So we'll go through in a bed or t what exactly is out of tree provider.
00:03:52 [W] Entry versus out of free little bit of background so entry what's actually an entry provider so previously all the flour providers or shipped with the kubernative main kubernative binaries. So
00:03:54 [W] Controller manager and all other occupied in Cube. API has some provider specific code with them.
00:04:03 [W] so later on these provider specific code has been extracted into a separate binary called as cesium and all the out of three providers implement this cloud of idle interface and run the
00:04:19 [W] The cluster so far openstack Cloud. So we have the openstack cloud controller manager to be running in the cluster.
00:04:32 [W] So from the fur out of tree provider so code is located in a separate repository and it's maintained and released independent of the kubernative Sur La main release.
00:04:40 [W] so kubernative
00:04:43 [W] kubernative sand cloud provider or integrated way single component called as flow controller manager.
00:05:00 [W] So so this entry provider basically or deprecated and or targeted for removal in 1.21. So all the migration activity so they have to be migrated who are using the entry providers
00:05:09 [W] I did.
00:05:13 [W] Coming to the hosted plug-in. So apart from openstax cloud controller manager, we whole set of other plugins as well which leverage which could be used for various different functionalities.
00:05:38 [W] So we'll go through bit about each of these plugins.
00:05:42 [W] So these can be enabled as required by the user.
00:05:43 [W] Openstack Cloud controller manager. So this is basically an implementation of external cloud provider for open star clusters.
00:05:59 [W] So this runs all the cloud specific Loops, like node controller service controller and wrap controllers, but volume controller. So not part of the cesium find read. So those are basically
00:06:08 [W] Done using a CSI drivers. So for now from the deployment perspective, there is some difference how the entry providers and out of three providers or deploy.
00:06:23 [W] So in the cube later, you have to mention floor provider as external so that the nodes or marked as uninitialized until the CCM binary is up and running and the other changes include qbp I server and
00:06:37 [W] Then you should also they shouldn't be any cloud provider flag to tell that not to run any Cloud specific groups.
00:06:49 [W] and then you have to deploy the cesium binary in your cluster. So for that we have provided set of manifest in the repo so it can be deployed as a demon set in your cluster using those manifest.
00:07:00 [W] One cesium is up and running so notes or Mark. There's initialized and ready to be schedulable.
00:07:07 [W] Octavia Ingress controller so this plug-in is basically used for load balancer man load balancer service.
00:07:23 [W] So it relies on the load balancer Octavia, which is the default implementation of load balancer service in openstack Cloud for this plugin to work. So there should be a connection between Octavia and baby angrist
00:07:35 [W] Secondly stable Queen's openstack version or the higher or is required for this to work. And if you want a further TLS Ingress so openstack Barbican also to be deployed in your openstack cloud.
00:07:51 [W] Coming to CSI drivers. So if you understand CSI is a standard for exposing the storage systems to the containerd eyes were closed. So it is widely being adopted so further in this report. We are hosting
00:08:11 [W] Yes, I drove us in the CSI and money last year sign. So in openstack single CSI is the sender is the block storage service and money lies the shared file system service. So these drivers implement containerd storageos
00:08:26 [W] Alain services
00:08:29 [W] with that entry like entry Cinder provisioner, which is used for volume management is deprecated.
00:08:43 [W] And so the the CSI driver must be used for this volume management for the migration. So there are set of flags like CSI migration and CSI migration openstack, so
00:08:52 [W] Ezel provided and can be enabled in Cube API and Q controller manager so that all the entry calls or routed to the CSI drivers.
00:09:07 [W] So before any bling this Flags, make sure you have the openstack CSI driver installed in your cluster.
00:09:11 [W] So for any new volume, so it is strongly suggested to use the new CSI driver instead.
00:09:21 [W] So if you're planning any migration activity SSO, you can we have a detailed guide given in our report so you can go through that before planning your my passion.
00:09:30 [W] We have set of other plugins like Keystone or Thin Client Keystone. So these are the two binaries that work together to provide to any able to use openstack credentials for authenticating kubernative clusters.
00:09:52 [W] Cool, but when you just Keystone iot some binary which implements the web hook authentication and authorization and the client Keystone Earth is the one which gets the bearer token in exchange for the user credentials that been
00:10:07 [W] Which can be later on passed to the Q Pi server.
00:10:11 [W] Barbican KMS plug-in, so this plug-in is can be used to encrypt and decrypt secret data using the key from the Barbican openstack cloud service.
00:10:24 [W] Magna me he Auto healer is one more plug in so that is the self healing cluster management service.
00:10:37 [W] So if you have multiple master and worker notes in your Magnum cluster, so it periodically monitors the health of the systems and Trigger and Replacements as and when required so these are all the plugins that are hosted
00:10:47 [W] so if you have a multiple master and worker nodes in your Magnum cluster, so it periodically monitors the health of the systems and Trigger and Replacements as and when required so these are all the plugins that are hosted
00:10:49 [W] Project. So the party to any deploy any of the plug-in you can go to we have a detailed documentation provided in the repo.
00:10:59 [W] could use the same and enable them in your cluster.
00:11:00 [W] Coming to Major updates we have been doing for the past few releases in or ccmc openstack Cloud controller manager.
00:11:15 [W] We have quite a few updates like support for UDP load balancing with Octavia is added and we have improved the logging and various other functionalities as well. And there is a multi architecture support so you can build the imagers and
00:11:29 [W] Lady is platforms and now Octavia Ingress controller supports TLS using Barbican.
00:11:36 [W] A few of the next steps that are planned for the coming releases one is reusing load balancer for different services and some of the dfac bring with the reconciler implementation for better maintainability.
00:11:52 [W] We have quite few updates in Cinder CSI plug-in. So latest driver version is 1.2.0.
00:12:07 [W] This driver is made in conformance with the CSI spec 1.2.0.
00:12:15 [W] So the Santee testing which ensures the conformance to the CSI or being or added to the see I jog so it is up and running apart from that we have
00:12:23 [W] Groaning support it is added to the driver and Cinder it can be now deployed using Helm also CSI migration openstack feature is promoted to Beta in 1.18, but it is default of
00:12:39 [W] Have added the CSI migration jobs as well in the CI to ensure it is it is City working? Everything is properly.
00:12:50 [W] Some of the ongoing and plant features for the coming Cycles. So definitely one is the stability and increased test coverage.
00:13:06 [W] coverage. So they has been already work being done as part of this. So we are because we are adding early to eat test for various features that are in progress and see I am proving the CIA jobs as well.
00:13:15 [W] I don't support it features.
00:13:23 [W] We already have many of the supported features like Roblox volume topology expansion snapshot Etc.
00:13:26 [W] With respect to Manila CSI plug-in. So we have the latest release of the driver is 0.9.0 and supported features with this Plug-In or snapshots in restoring snail shells from the snapshots,
00:13:46 [W] Other supported features like Roblox volume topology expansion snapshot Etc.
00:13:47 [W] With respect to Manila CSI plug-in. So we have the latest release of the driver is 0.9.0 and supported features with this Plug-In or snapshots in restoring snail shells from the snapshots,
00:13:49 [W] Be in the face only and this is support added for the topology and Manila availability zones as well and deployment using help is also supported.
00:13:58 [W] plant features further some of these are the plant features that are targeted for the coming releases set is volume expansion support monitoring support with Prometheus and also the high availability
00:14:14 [W] Coming to the deprecation. So in 1.18, we have done quite a few deprecations like Standalone Cinder provisioner Manila provisioner and Cinder Flex volume plugins, which are hosted were previously part of the report being deprecated now
00:14:35 [W] It 1.1 it so it is in favor of the CSI and neutron elba's is already deprecated from openstack Queens release.
00:14:47 [W] So it is now no longer maintained in openstack Cloud controller manager as well so default.
00:14:52 [W] default load balancer implementation uses Octavia from 1.18 release
00:15:00 [W] So openstack entry provider is deprecated and targeted for removal in 1.21 as I have mentioned.
00:15:09 [W] So, please plan your migration activity according to rain.
00:15:12 [W] Show now you have got said idea about the project. So if you want to get involved with us, so if here's a getting started guide we have provided in the report so you can go through it and install the plug-in and the code is
00:15:33 [W] So now you have got said idea about the project. So if you want to get involved with us, so here's a getting started guide. We have provided in the report so you can go through it and install the plug-in and the code is
00:15:35 [W] SQL any dust cloud provided openstack URL. So for any issues features feature request, you could always raised and feature requests in the GitHub as well if you are interested in sea ice over
00:15:48 [W] Also hosted on Open Lab infrastructure so you can check out the job center.
00:15:54 [W] So Phi to get involved more into the project, so please reach out to us on provider openstack channels.
00:16:03 [W] You can reach out to any of us.
00:16:05 [W] We are always happy to help.
00:16:06 [W] Okay.
00:16:16 [W] Thank you everyone for joining so up for any questions.
00:16:20 [W] Hello.
00:16:33 [W] Hello.
00:16:34 [W] We have a couple of questions here.
00:16:42 [W] I know she'll do you want to answer some of them?
00:16:43 [W] Yeah, so about the slide. So I'll upload it the today after the session so you can download it from that that shed you'll the session I'll be uploading them there
00:17:00 [W] So the one question on the application credential so I think it's it's already supported since long time.
00:17:21 [W] So I guess you're facing some issues.
00:17:24 [W] So you could reach out to us on provider openstack Channel or you could create issue so we could help you out there if you're facing an issue.
00:17:30 [W] But yeah, it's it's supported.
00:17:33 [W] Then we have another another question for Octavia that openebs. I'm gonna hit tation and if we can change it back or if the user can change it back to a enable the neutron are vast and that's fairly easy by just configuring
00:17:51 [W] It's false in the cloud configuration Network provider configuration.
00:17:58 [W] and then the old implementation kicks in.
00:18:00 [W] Before that we did it differently. You have to activate it by setting the flag to to so true.
00:18:11 [W] But now through is the default and you can switch it back at any time.
00:18:12 [W] We have one question if we have an idea when volume expansion is planned.
00:18:26 [W] I'm sure do you have any information about that?
00:18:29 [W] Yeah volume if you're talking about the CSI for all for the money La Cinder or Manila.
00:18:44 [W] So if it's further Cinder, it's already there if it's money like I guess it's it's plant.
00:18:51 [W] We don't have the exact timeline. But if it's a priority you can log the issue so we can ask someone to take it up. So
00:18:55 [W] First online and offline voters about it.
00:19:04 [W] Yeah.
00:19:06 [W] I'll go ahead Crystal. Okay.
00:19:08 [W] We're for one question of which parts of Manila will be AJ.
00:19:19 [W] Should be AJ Clark provider must provide that so that's nothing that we can do.
00:19:28 [W] just talk to the API and attach volumes to the notes and Cupid's them into your pots.
00:19:34 [W] The next question or their plans to introduce backports for older version.
00:20:00 [W] So if if you could let me know which parts because if it's generally we don't add if it's a very
00:20:07 [W] Or we do add the backboard.
00:20:15 [W] So if any important bugs issues and we do release an image update so you can find in the docker Hub about the release of grades of hosts or cesium or the CSI binaries. You could find it like
00:20:26 [W] So we could have made some bad portworx has and released again.
00:20:37 [W] So if you want if you want any of the specific bug issue, you could let us know that we will take it up to the back part of the older releases.
00:20:43 [W] So I'm graph one.
00:20:52 [W] I think it's the last question here.
00:20:52 [W] Q control good no croutons and error. It opens up credentials are not configured correctly.
00:21:01 [W] Well, I think there is no way to load but new credentials without reads every starting the pot. But if that is the question if I understand that correctly, I'm not sure.
00:21:14 [W] So you have to so this is part of the secret, right? So you have to again change the in Cloud config and recreate the secret and I think it should be up and running but
00:21:31 [W] Yeah, the porch should be restarted I guess.
00:21:36 [W] Okay.
00:21:49 [W] I think we went through most of that.
00:21:53 [W] You can add the schedule link you could wear you could get the slides so I can add it on the slack channel so you could get it from there.
00:22:08 [W] So to puke on maintainer channel where we have a thread for the Q&A so you could ask your questions there too.
00:22:18 [W] So we'll be able to answer that and I'll paste the link for the slides there once I upload today.
00:22:24 [W] Okay, then.
00:22:30 [W] thank you all for your time.
00:22:37 [W] And I appreciate that you are here and if you have any questions any further questions, please reach out. I think we have we have one more in the next page I guess.
00:22:45 [W] Oh, sorry that was mentioned before and I missed that.
00:22:51 [W] If Octavia is false, we need something like metal at B and know when you're fatigued as false the old implementation kicks in which means that Neutron a device must be deployed at your cloud provider.
00:23:08 [W] This is nothing that you could do. If your cloud provider neither have Octavian or Neutron Airbus, then you meet something like natural be.
00:23:18 [W] And we again have the question for the trap for the share link.
00:23:24 [W] Yeah, so I guess you could chat is there on the flag? So thank you all for joining the session.
00:23:36 [W] Enjoy your clipboard to reach out to us either wires, like on in the communities like which was linked in one of our slides and please engage in our GitHub issues or pull requests and anything is welcome.
00:23:52 [W] Actually if there are things like the question about keep control get notary turns are on if you have any problems with that, please reach out. We maybe can help you with that.
