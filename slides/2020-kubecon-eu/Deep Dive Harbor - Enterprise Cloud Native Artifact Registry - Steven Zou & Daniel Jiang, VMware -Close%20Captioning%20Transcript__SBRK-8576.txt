00:01:41 [W] Let's get started. Oh, hello everyone.
00:10:44 [W] Welcome to the deep end of session of a cncf or hostile project Harbor.
00:10:47 [W] I must even to Harbor maintainer.
00:10:47 [W] Currently.
00:10:52 [W] I'm working and VMware Beijing are the center as a staff of software engineer today in this session are cool speaker with another Harbor mattina than your Dell Daniel.
00:10:58 [W] I work in the same team with Stephen.
00:11:03 [W] Okay, we are so glad to have this chance to share with you some of the latest updates and the related development of plan and we'll post Harbor project and a Harbor community.
00:11:17 [W] Before formally start I'm so glad to share with you the excited and the great achievement for the whole Harbor community.
00:11:27 [W] We Harbor graduate Harbor becomes the 11:1 karate later project.
00:11:37 [W] Obviously this achievement belongs to the whole Harbor community.
00:11:39 [W] We loans to all of you Harbor users partners and the contributors really appreciate girl deletion is now to the under but two to three new start.
00:11:49 [W] Port the Harbor community were working harder and the continuing to push the project forward more quickly and the heart surgery
00:11:56 [W] and the Harbor community
00:12:03 [W] Before formally start I'm so glad to share with you the excited and the great achievement for the whole Harbor community.
00:12:04 [W] We Harbor graduate Harbor becomes the 11:1 karate later project.
00:12:06 [W] Obviously this achievement belongs to the whole Harbor community balloons to all of you.
00:12:07 [W] Harbor users partners and the contributors really appreciate girl deletion is now to the under but two to three new starting portworx.
00:12:08 [W] The Harbor community were working harder and the continue to push the project forward more quickly and the heart surgery.
00:12:12 [W] Here is today's agenda.
00:12:12 [W] It mainly has the following parts for styra quickly update to the latest state of the Harbor community.
00:12:13 [W] Next Daniel will give you a review of the key features changes.
00:12:14 [W] We deliver the in the latest major release mm arrow and the highlights of the anchor features. That would be released the in the upcoming major release 2.1 including non-blocking GC and the proxy to cash later article over
00:12:27 [W] But these are the latest Estates of the Harbor community next Daniel will give you a review of the key features the changes we deliver the in the latest major release 2.0 and the highlighted the anchor features. That would be released to in the
00:12:29 [W] We introduced to some other to both of our release like a PWC pre heat and extended the processor this the features our leader by the community what groups finally I would like to share with you some of the
00:12:42 [W] A direction that is our of the map. We're leave several minutes for Q&A after the presentation.
00:12:52 [W] Let's take a look at the latest status of a Harbor community when little taper the data showing in this threat of Romans that devastates represent the powered by the cncf under the inside the page of GitHub.
00:13:11 [W] It can be clearly seen from the detail that Harbor community is thriving overall data shown at the left side Q made of July. We have gained private Stalin and the three hundred Stars
00:13:23 [W] It can be clearly seen from the theatre that Harbor community is a thriving overall data shown at the left side Q made of July. We have gained private Stalin and the three hundred Stars at the kid
00:13:26 [W] No, we have more than 200 committers about our meeting a group.
00:13:33 [W] There are 14 metres across five come companies located at the four countries more details sugar and to the right side.
00:13:45 [W] They can give us some more insight of the community Lebanese.
00:13:47 [W] We have more than 50 contributing companies. We have three more than 3,000 contribution to our country.
00:13:55 [W] Looters we also have more than four.
00:14:00 [W] So then the fox more than 12,000 commits.
00:14:11 [W] Okay in the past two weeks, there are sixty, so then the wheels to the GitHub repo from a more than 11,000 the visitors at the related the package have been downloaded more than five
00:14:16 [W] Hasta two weeks the bottom will curve of growth through the facts of that.
00:14:25 [W] that. The project is activity Mitten and a week ago too many comments that I receive from different contributors.
00:14:31 [W] Okay our head over the time to Daniel to talk about what we deliver the in the 2000 arrow and the what we have anchor features in the upcoming 2.1 and know.
00:14:49 [W] Okay.
00:14:49 [W] Thanks Steven guys, as for now the harbor V 2.0 has been released for some time. But let me take a couple of minutes to recap the key changes. We brought in this release Envy total zero we extended hashicorp.
00:15:04 [W] Our scope from managing container images or counterparts to all oci artifacts including the charge package by Henry III no see I format Opa bundle seen app is actually their truck and these are
00:15:19 [W] Be stored in the single registry instance coexist in the Repose of Harbor and restricted by the same permission rules.
00:15:33 [W] As long as they can be pushed and pulled by the distribution D to a pi and this allowed us to use the same code path and workflow to manage all types of artifacts such that the policies we introduced to maintain
00:15:43 [W] To manage container images such as replication tag retention immutability will still be applicable to the new artifacts as wheel as well because we now see the abstract
00:15:59 [W] artifacts as the object for management we managed to introduce an extensible approach to process requests to push the artifact Harbor to extract and display different attributes
00:16:14 [W] It's on the type of the artifacts and this is extensible framework and you'll see later in this presentation that in the version 2.1. Our partners in community will leverage this framework to enable Harbor to manage the machine
00:16:29 [W] the model they develop and in addition to that with the new artifact model, we fix the historical issues the harbor cannot manage Manifest this correctly now the Manifest lists or image indexes
00:16:44 [W] Can be pushed to Harbor and serve they'll manage there's a special artifact which has reference to other artifacts last but not least.
00:16:56 [W] We also made other enhancements in version 2.0.
00:17:07 [W] For example on maintainers from Aqua security introduce the integration with new scanning to Chile and you can enable TLS communication for internal components during installation is actual.
00:17:12 [W] Internal components during installation.
00:17:12 [W] Is that rock?
00:17:17 [W] So with that said if you haven't upgraded to 2.0, please go check it out and give us feedback, but there are lots of cool stuff there.
00:17:27 [W] Now after the recap we'd like to introduce a few interesting new features that will be provided into that box.
00:17:30 [W] first the new garbage collector
00:17:35 [W] As we know in the registry the layers or blobs are shared across in it is so when an image is removed the storage taken by the polyps can be free because they may be referenced by other images.
00:17:50 [W] It is even if the reference count off a blob is zero income current scenario an image reference in this blob. Maybe being pushed to the registry at the same time. You do the division.
00:18:05 [W] Therefore currently. We need to pull Harbor in read-only mode and Trigger the distributions GC command to be the blobs and Frieda storage, but there's this one's disadvantage of this approach the
00:18:18 [W] Use a needs to work through all the images to find out which mlops can be garbage collected. And when the number of the image is huge or the backend storage is relatively slow.
00:18:33 [W] However will stay in read-only for a long time sometimes if too long to be acceptable.
00:18:40 [W] So we want to see what we can do to mitigate the problem considering in one deny. When we introduced the quota management to calculate the storage usage. We keep track for all the blobs and the relationship with artifacts and
00:18:55 [W] Products with these data we can figure out the reference count of laps with a relatively low cost so you don't need to work through all the images in the storage.
00:19:09 [W] Additionally. We have the database we can take advantage of these strong consistency which introduced mark-and-sweep strategy to avoid the problem in concurrent scenario and
00:19:21 [W] I'll handle her you will access the storage data directly to remove the blob instead of relying on the distribution command.
00:19:35 [W] So T SE can continue without having to pull the whole registry in to read only mode. So you can do push or deletion. Well, the GC is running Additionally leveraging the information we have in the DB we
00:19:45 [W] I'd estimation to administrator about how much storage will be freed. After the GC is complete completed, which should be very helpful for admins to decide whether or not to
00:20:00 [W] Storage or run a GC 2 free storage and this feature has been damned old and revealed in our community meetings.
00:20:15 [W] The code has been merged to master Branch as I'm doing this recording a hopefully by the time you see this video.
00:20:17 [W] There is an RC 4 mm for you to try next page, please.
00:20:21 [W] Another feature I want to mention is the proxy cash we noticed there have been asked from many users who want to sell Harbor to mirror to mirror images from Docker Hub search that Harbor can act like a proxy
00:20:40 [W] And the user can pull images from Dover Harbour in air gap environment.
00:20:47 [W] We know you can set this tribution to mirror mode and but there is a limitation that the mirror mode distribution is read-only. You cannot push limits to it and we cannot simply bring up two instances
00:20:58 [W] Is Miro and one is writable because once the URI is Clash the images will overwrite each one another and we used to think with the pool mode replication.
00:21:12 [W] Such requirement can be addressed.
00:21:15 [W] But the experience was not good enough because the reputation is a async job and not not until the job is successfully finished.
00:21:27 [W] Can the image be available for pulling this?
00:21:28 [W] Generally, there's no guarantee that the images are up to date because when it's updated on the docker Hub side Harbor can be notified the in 2001. We introduce extra attributes at project level.
00:21:43 [W] So you can associate a project with the registry in point used for replication. When you issue Pokémon to the URI from under this project a middleware will trigger part of the reputation code.
00:21:56 [W] Images will be pulled from the remote registry and the content will be served to the client by the same time.
00:22:05 [W] It's written to the storage.
00:22:08 [W] It's just like the T command and like the regular product. You can apply tag retention call the management policy to control the storage usage for the proxy the images and you can even trigger scan to find
00:22:21 [W] All of the images prostate whether to they have any vulnerabilities because the prophet image are local.
00:22:34 [W] So we reuse the code in replication adapters under the hood.
00:22:40 [W] So let's see a radically we can proxy images from already trees that we can do with the occasion but due to limited time for testing into the why you only can process the images from Dover Harbour and other Harbor instances when we have a solid
00:22:50 [W] about the past all the replication of Baptists will enable processing other type of Registries such as you see RTC Are you better I think this feature will not only benefit the air gaps in area but also in the edge scenarios
00:23:05 [W] When you only push image to the central registry, you can easily put them onto the a dreaded tree and it can work as an on-demand or lazy reputation.
00:23:21 [W] as a time of recording this feature has also been enabled in master branch and it's available in the tab build already. It will for sure be part of to no one.
00:23:30 [W] Okay, that's my part.
00:23:33 [W] Let me hand it back to Stephen for other cool stuff and work group in vertical not one peep.
00:23:39 [W] Okay.
00:23:44 [W] Thanks Daniel for the wonderful introduction besides the to Anchor the feature the non-blocking and the proxy cash introduced about Daniel Johnston all here. I'd like to highlight another to Features introduced the in the 2001 release
00:23:56 [W] Thora is P2 P4 hate at the window petabyte-scale can Harbor to accelerate the content that is specific distribution process. The sensor for project dragonfly and Wilbur OSS project correct can also use the P2P technology
00:24:12 [W] Suppose the efficient container a major distribution process preheater will provide our letter with way for users to leverage the capability of the pitot pressure injuries, like a dragonfly and the cracker to
00:24:27 [W] It says that a major distribution process where the pre-heat your sarkar register the API endpoints of their people keep changes in the harbor and then targeting the register petabyte-scale NJ or policy
00:24:41 [W] Be accredited to sobota Phi what image are qualified and the ready to distribute into the P2P Network a cash in advance Cash seeing the image content into petabyte-scale work in advance can make sure all the
00:24:56 [W] Peter pieces required by the P2P network has been there and I know needed to download the zoo's first corporate data removed from the salsa registry. This can reduce the latest when putting request a happened
00:25:11 [W] the P2P Network
00:25:13 [W] multiple Fator filters and quiet here can be syseleven the policy use repository filter to narrow down the image repository use tag or filter to narrow down the text of the Matched amye Repository.
00:25:33 [W] Mark only send a mirror to only hello.
00:25:39 [W] I'm either way the signature to be preheated sight of all abilities serverless T Bar to make sure only the secure image of acceptable provide the labor of the to limit only a meter with the specified delivers can be selected.
00:25:52 [W] The policy can be enforced the battle precise schedule or based on the related events, like on push on label and the sky complete the feature is designed and the developer by the P2P workloads.
00:26:03 [W] Rupa members of from VMware a lot of decent Natalie is Ali Baba and Wilbur great. Thanks to them.
00:26:13 [W] The next one is extender extended artifact processor and we read introduce the in the previous slide Harbor supports managing and distributing the artifacts that following the OCS back from 2.0
00:26:30 [W] besides the basic info of the wholesale artifact Harbor also defend on meta data processor interface to extract more metadata from the configure or content blob of the wholesale artifacts and the returns
00:26:45 [W] Theatre in the harbor API, however, currently Harbor only handles the some of the were known standard artifact kinda like a higher more base richart all seen enough by implementing specified mayadata
00:27:00 [W] Processors for the non-standard that is user Defender also artifacts and as no relevant processor existing most of the meta data cannot be extracted out this shortage makes Harbor
00:27:14 [W] Couple it could sensibilities.
00:27:16 [W] In 2001 where extended the default the processor to identify the non-standard artifacts can not harm research are not as a nap and the not 0.08. The extractors are related the Kiwi metadata from the
00:27:32 [W] Coffee Co problem and the other content of blah but that's a marked with specified annotations and also retains those extracted the data in the harbor API.
00:27:46 [W] a donated annotation we can use and what do they represent will be different the into a simple metadata spok for user to refer.
00:27:52 [W] This feature is the lead by the Thai Cloud team with this feature user can build their own specify the artifact management and the distribution platform on top of a harbor for example, like a feature contributor.
00:28:06 [W] tight clothes. Do you all say are compatible machine learning Model Management platform?
00:28:12 [W] Okay, after talking about the features of 2001. Let's see more long term applied of the in our roadmap. The planetariums are grouped into three perspective management distribution and extensibility.
00:28:29 [W] The item is highlighted with the wider color are the ones we have already been working on in 2.1 like a non-blocking procs cash PW the defendant artifact processor and one more vulnerability scanner from
00:28:44 [W] Sysdig about a harbor operator ovhcloud team has contributed the first version of Harbor operator the version 0.25 now they are working on the release 1.0 that includes
00:29:00 [W] Lots of excellent improvements. It should be ready recently based on the Harbor operator. The operator work group of a Harbor community has studied the work to build a harbor cluster operator
00:29:14 [W] The ghoul over the harbor Club class. The operator is a deploying Harbor with all its dependencies service database right is storage, you know hmm owed the first version of their root of f should be ready before
00:29:30 [W] Another August before such on guillon items.
00:29:37 [W] We are also looking at Windows containers improved support for Windows containerless observability expose Harbor metric is Rule from essos integration
00:29:49 [W] Pete version 6 only network of for Harbor puts, you know, kubernative cluster. Okay back Harbor on the wrist all leverage retrieve a literal to offer application-aware Harbor back up including database kubernative
00:30:05 [W] And our persistence volumes and that it he and accept management and our back we will do some research on service accounts with proper are back and the different knative access permissions
00:30:20 [W] The Marty pool tennis rule ability to manage teams of the users and the robotic arms through workspace.
00:30:28 [W] Okay, welcome to do collaboration with Harbor community. We have several ways for you to be involved in the community.
00:30:46 [W] You can join the slide concerns are for workspace and defend our sins the - Harbor Channel that's for user and - Harbor TV channel for development all sentimental to us or follow Harbor in Twitter.
00:30:53 [W] We have a biweekly Community Zoom meetings to update the latest series of Harbor project and the community or do preview demos of the new features.
00:30:59 [W] Welcome to join. There are two temples
00:31:04 [W] Well for Asian Pacific plus European and the one for America's plus European, you can find the meeting detailed in the reader me of Harbor project alligator Harbor for the morrow. We have deployed a demo environment for you to have a
00:31:16 [W] Assess their motto to go Harbor dot IO.
00:31:19 [W] So that's all the content of this presentation is to kill and a time. Any question. We are here and the listening to you. Thank you.
00:31:29 [W] So I just hide the answer or answer it, you know using my song as An organ answer the question directly.
00:32:07 [W] As from question number 6. Can I use power in arm from I see?
00:32:19 [W] Yeah, of course you can you can download the offline installer where all the images are bundled together.
00:32:23 [W] I think we should answer on that one, right?
00:32:31 [W] The first one is about says a reservation.
00:32:36 [W] Yeah, I have typed the answer. Actually.
00:32:45 [W] For user to customize the role. We have done some groundwork. So under the hood, the permission is already customizable, but I think that hard part is how to expose this capability
00:32:56 [W] We don't want you know, there are tens of chatbots is on the UI for you to choose. So we need to think about a better way to expose this feature.
00:33:10 [W] But yeah, we are thinking about it, but we don't have a very concrete plan yet.
00:33:14 [W] That's what comparing Harbor with Nexus II cannot answer this. I don't have much experience using the Nats as a repository.
00:33:22 [W] Question number four is probably cash local to container that talks to the storage.
00:33:36 [W] I'm a little confused about the question that I can clarify that the policy proxy.
00:33:45 [W] I mean the cached artifacts the Blobs of them are shared with images you push so it's stored in the one storage back-end.
00:33:48 [W] Number 5. Can you post the nun demo URLs? I'm not sure what demo
00:33:57 [W] but that money environment, right?
00:34:03 [W] Barber in thermos of coffee of yours is on permits. Are ya.
00:34:17 [W] Well, that's not quite sad.
00:34:26 [W] statement
00:34:28 [W] okay, one for the family room and you can navigate the truth at a motel to cohabit or tile.
00:34:48 [W] That's yeah, it's pretty install the environment able to have tried will upgrade to it temp a temp to make a sure. It's it's it's have the latest feature.
00:35:01 [W] Is there any tool to push images from kubernative to Harbor?
00:35:07 [W] It's open source, so I really don't know.
00:35:18 [W] Yeah, no wonder I don't think we can talk about you know the product.
00:35:24 [W] Yeah, we don't care.
00:35:27 [W] We don't have any Cornelius the plug-in to do that.
00:35:31 [W] User right click each of the image on their own instead of the mises side Harbor repetition on framers.
00:35:45 [W] Instead of I think the question the meaning is so far. The replication can be only on the create a better system.
00:35:55 [W] Yeah, we have heard of some ways the from the community and we are considering maybe but no guarantee plan to support, you know, no citizen
00:36:13 [W] You level replication feature so far.
00:36:15 [W] Any other cooking?
00:36:23 [W] Yeah.
00:36:29 [W] From although there's a page to a number 12 the NES.
00:36:44 [W] Can you rename products?
00:36:55 [W] Actually, I think after we move the data, I mean previously is definitely not possible because we delegate all information to the registry. I mean the the distribution instance.
00:36:59 [W] So you cannot rename it because the URI will not change but now maybe it's possible at any why don't you write have an issue and yeah, I think it may be possible
00:37:15 [W] So in the future and number 13 is the deletion of products working already.
00:37:25 [W] It kept giving an arrow and never did it hit the product it is. Yeah. It is the by design that you have to remove all repository and all members from the product before you can delete it.
00:37:37 [W] number 47 we have
00:37:42 [W] we have deployed hovering kubernative how proxy cat Works inside kubernative kubernetes deployment of Harbor essentially
00:38:01 [W] Like I said, it works exactly like reputation if your Harbor deployment inside kubernative can replicate the image from Docker Hub.
00:38:16 [W] You can proxy them you make you need to make sure then you know, the network allows you to
00:38:26 [W] pull data from Docker Hub to the harbor poddisruptionbudgets.
00:38:32 [W] Yeah, I don't think they own the if you use the same same same adapter or you know, you're so bad each of the same code. Do you think hold the data needed to confirm that
00:38:47 [W] Turn the harbor and the Upstream already three, you know working.
00:38:55 [W] Well, so that make me okay.
00:38:56 [W] A hardcore match provide the magic for yourself to Pieces PC information has for me so far. I don't think we we we don't support any you know.
00:39:11 [W] four muscles Matrix, right
00:39:14 [W] No, but we are we are designing currently.
00:39:20 [W] We are designing the 2.2.
00:39:23 [W] We will expose some of the metrics probably we will leverage opentelemetry, but you know the still thinking but currently there is no
00:39:35 [W] Search metric sending two promises.
00:39:41 [W] Any other questions?
00:39:55 [W] Yeah, actually.
00:40:01 [W] The question is about Artie detail push kubernative portray makes from kubernative Harbor.
00:40:14 [W] Actually, I don't really understand there's an arrow from all the working mode.
00:40:19 [W] por fin
00:40:22 [W] I don't really understand the question.
00:40:46 [W] Actually photos and narrow, you know Porsha image of from kubernative some worker node the to Harbor.
00:41:00 [W] Pull yeah, I think for the end-to-end probably you wanna set up maybe you're talking about setting up a pipeline using kubernative and build your code in the
00:41:15 [W] What kubernative spot and push the artifact it is possible.
00:41:22 [W] just don't know there's any tool to help you do that. So that's definitely possible.
00:41:24 [W] I think this time it's cold.
00:41:44 [W] Okay.
00:42:02 [W] Thank you guys.
00:42:02 [W] There's a new there's a new question from Danny. Look at the number 18 asking about trivia and Tracy.
00:42:11 [W] You heard of Tracy?
00:42:16 [W] I'm not sure what it is.
00:42:17 [W] Now, I don't know her that she see so far away support the treaty and the foremost gunnard, you know, because it's so open spackle. So if the treaty provided want to integrate with a harbor
00:42:33 [W] To provide that in the last an abductor them.
00:42:39 [W] then yeah Tracy can support, you know integration with Harbor.
00:42:42 [W] Bye-bye.
00:42:44 [W] definitely
00:42:51 [W] actually, we have maintained or from alcohol we can talk about them. And yeah, we need to wrap up the Q&A now. Please reach out to us as left handle and give approval.
00:43:02 [W] See you guys.
00:43:03 [W] Bye. Bye. Bye.
