00:02:13 [W] Hello everybody and welcome to this stall consider this introduction token kubernative in production, but before beginning, let me introduce ourselves.
00:02:28 [W] I introducing ovhcloud.
00:02:29 [W] I am already on salads as you can her.
00:02:35 [W] I have a word accent.
00:02:37 [W] I am I spaniel living in France.
00:02:38 [W] Sorry about that.
00:02:41 [W] I am head of the trail developer relations at ovhcloud.
00:02:47 [W] And here you have any and I'm killing rorge.
00:02:49 [W] I work for her birthday, too.
00:02:51 [W] current is engineering manager. So I'm just I'm just lead of the team who run or Humanities of her.
00:02:58 [W] Ovhcloud.
00:03:07 [W] Yeah, we are one of the world leaders in c
 present everywhere in the world with over 30 data centers
00:03:17 [W] Ovhcloud.
00:03:18 [W] Yeah, we are one of the world leaders in cloud and hosting we are a smaller than some of our Silicon Valley competitors, but we are present everywhere in the world with over 30 data centers lots and
00:03:19 [W] Commercial and a catalog of products that will allows you to find almost everything you should need including a manage kubernative, but we are here to talk about ovhcloud.
00:03:32 [W] We are here to talk about overnight s so you may remember some years ago.
00:03:45 [W] Everybody was doing it on bare metal servers. So you have your server to expel you.
00:03:48 [W] Operative systems are your application on your operating systems?
00:03:53 [W] It was a robust parodied me is worked well, but it wasn't very agile when you needed to add some instances. It was complicated later.
00:04:07 [W] We had a beautiful machines and everything was easier your had a beautiful machine your operative systems are your application but in the last year you have seen more and more.
00:04:19 [W] Of container why because containers were easy.
00:04:24 [W] What do you see for who they were before all easy for developers.
00:04:31 [W] That was the big selling point of Docker.
00:04:38 [W] They weren't the first container engine. That was the first container and guide developer friendly.
00:04:42 [W] So you could install complicating things in your computer as easily as in production and the image. Do you know?
00:04:48 [W] Immaculate going to run on production but for devops thinks what an easier with containers I should say they were even more complicated there was more things to tame especially
00:05:05 [W] They were even more complicated.
00:05:06 [W] There was more things to tame, especially when with containers we had microservices and then before you only had one big application in one bill 12 machine,
00:05:16 [W] And Bill 12 machine and now you have some 20 30 containers run around and you need to keep that alive and working.
00:05:26 [W] That's why in my opinion kubernative is so big success because it's allows you to tame this complexity in an easy way.
00:05:38 [W] So yeah you are going to declare. What do you want you are going to declare what what
00:05:44 [W] kind of impressed Rook through you want to deploy but all the loader will details are done by kubernative.
00:05:54 [W] It's almost like it.
00:05:55 [W] It was your robotic intern you don't date high level View and he does all the small work and it's really it's an interesting is that many good points been able to clone
00:06:09 [W] Beyond man, for example being able to deploy complicated things easily been able to replicate but you already have deployed and especially there is one big big selling point it is easy to learn
00:06:24 [W] Especially because like we think like minikube or k3s you can are going to be able to test kubernative in your laptop in your personal computer in some Raspberry Pi
00:06:40 [W] And you are going to be able to deploy all these complicated architectures in your laptop in kubernative.
00:06:49 [W] Okay, it is your laptop.
00:06:53 [W] It is going to be slow not your laptop is going to get hot but it is going to work.
00:06:58 [W] And then okay after some evenings playing with kubernative are going to tell yourself a I have deployed this big things this cluster C distributed system and kubernative.
00:07:13 [W] I am ready for going to production and that's the problem.
00:07:18 [W] Here you have at the left Edge or minikube.
00:07:25 [W] Hey, you guys are doing really kubernative particular laptop.
00:07:36 [W] When you begin to do your homework and installing your kubernative Singsong virtual machines.
00:07:37 [W] You are there you are going further that most tutorial saying the internet but you want to still there, but between your a small development kubernative and unreal production,
00:07:49 [W] The kubernative well, like Akbar says it's a trap or whether there are lots of traps.
00:08:01 [W] So in this talk, we are going to try to introduce you to some of these straps and to give you some pointers to think that you should be aware before putting your kubernative
00:08:14 [W] production
00:08:15 [W] So yes, we are going to take a little journey to running an application on minikube to running prediction clusters.
00:08:30 [W] We are using some examples to the ribs at several communities.
00:08:35 [W] Wonderful.
00:08:37 [W] wonderful for the repairs is wonderful for devops because it's really easy to use your real you simply have to describe it and it runs but there are many things that run under the loodse.
00:08:47 [W] To manage the network to connect the storage and many parameters and things to take care to have program performances and proper secrecy levels.
00:09:01 [W] So we are going to to details some of them that we encounter on a daily basis.
00:09:11 [W] So our first example this is a really simple half who runs total own and anode don't have any dependencies and communities.
00:09:17 [W] And only require access to an external resources, so we have two nerves two halves and everything goes well, but at some point you also have security team.
00:09:32 [W] We are going to hold it you hop and how you deploy it and as you add doesn't require access from the other side, you know redo request to subside don't have to access it
00:09:46 [W] Fatima is going to add some English rules who deny increased traffic.
00:09:51 [W] and at this point you will see was that one of you up it's going to break because you don't have access to external resources any more on why don't I sound through this anymore
00:10:07 [W] We have a DNS service.
00:10:12 [W] who is run as a handicap.
00:10:16 [W] So we don't as Abode on YouTube and sisters and you app have to do the S resolution to access external resources because you use the NSC which is a good good use case and so
00:10:29 [W] Without access to the DNS in local is doing to work well, but the app on the other node.
00:10:36 [W] Don't have access anymore to DNS service.
00:10:40 [W] So when we won't be able to to access the internet anymore.
00:10:45 [W] And this is only one example of a very particular kind of problem with kubernative.
00:10:55 [W] is that when everything is working it is wonderful.
00:10:58 [W] It is sample, but when things break you need to understand all the different layers of abstractions that kubernative at this layers of instructions are wonderful, because they
00:11:12 [W] hide the complexity and they allows to automate lot of things, but when things aren't working you need to need to be aware of distractions and you need to learn to dig down from the
00:11:27 [W] Tom you're one of your pot is an able anymore to contact the spurn addresses to the underlying reason a there is an incoming traffic to some of your notes that has been closed by a
00:11:41 [W] okay Rule and this digging down there sections can be tricky especially at the beginning because it's really the image is that there are layers and layers and layers an error message
00:11:56 [W] I didn't always clearly transmitted from a lawyer to the upper one.
00:12:03 [W] Another example of networking is key proxy haproxy is a component responsible of sitting there put on your customers.
00:12:15 [W] So it's a component who set up service route.
00:12:17 [W] It's also set up nodebots that it's our connections are going inside your custard.
00:12:26 [W] So current is a street proximate is a space which is not duplicated if you tables and impervious.
00:12:30 [W] You're only but they don't see the default one because it considers the best implementation right now by he releases and so drilling on this if you do not set up anything the issue
00:12:45 [W] With a better neighbors helping neighbors is sent design from doing the dancing the design for doing a network filtering and it's based on rooms.
00:13:00 [W] So when you make the request each of the rows are evaluated differently Reno money.
00:13:07 [W] you have the more time you have to insert them and more important the more time you have to evaluate them.
00:13:12 [W] So as you close the grill and more than service us Network preferences are going to decrease which really drastically in fact, you can go to
00:13:27 [W] At some point and so it's because because of the rule evaluations based on chain. These are invitations you SS which is a load balancer integrated into the Linux kernel, it's based on
00:13:43 [W] Stables as it was a great because when you have the quest you can make it hashicorp.
00:14:03 [W] That's only one example networking is one of the trickiest part of kubernative.
00:14:13 [W] You have a lot of different network plugins. Each one is doing things in a slightly different way.
00:14:21 [W] You have activation distributed systems or things are running.
00:14:28 [W] Sometimes they are sometimes they are you have also all the complexity of how do you access your service from the outside and if you are adding things like servicemeshcon or is still they are adding new levels of abstraction.
00:14:35 [W] With some Hagen levels view but also you ligers at can hide problems things. Like latency can be held when you have so many unexpected latency between your master and your etcd pallets, for example, so
00:14:50 [W] It better resume would be networking is complicated and kubernative.
00:15:01 [W] Please before going to production try to understand it or try to have somebody in your team with good with networking because it is going to be one of the pain points.
00:15:10 [W] Another pain point is the story from the beginning kubernative which means to be a computer engineer in the idea was doing a stateless workloads.
00:15:19 [W] Butane around stateless workloads, like what looks like containers at the beginning for example, but as for containers soon enough everybody wanted to put some estate full application in kubernative.
00:15:35 [W] So they added the persistent volumes per system volumes claim and when you are in development these things are going to work without much problem, but in production, it is Marcin much more complicated.
00:15:47 [W] It looks office storage laces for different kind of storage back-end.
00:15:57 [W] What protocol as you you seen by the Fall you are using NFS.
00:16:01 [W] It isn't the best solution for applications like database. For example, you need to be sure that synchronism between them is well done.
00:16:10 [W] You need to be stronger able to do a back end of your storage and then kubernative.
00:16:13 [W] It's going to be able to restore this back and there are many things to think about before going in production.
00:16:17 [W] Persistent storage and it one thing that can be rather blocking.
00:16:26 [W] So try to think about that early your project and discuss with your production people to see what are they available solution including France took to you to do this persistent volume and to do all the logistics around
00:16:38 [W] if so and grantees as many components volumes are handled through interphase poverty amidst the CSI, so compared to the rate interface and so it's how you tell you linked your
00:16:56 [W] three clusters with your transistors there are many of them and they're both are the same are features, but most important most of them assume a perfect synchronization between kubenetes and
00:17:12 [W] I also assume that they are the only operation from grantees to the stressors and no variation on the stretch Closer by itself.
00:17:19 [W] That's the life will position storageos Earth asteroid dragons likely subjects you arose or mutton owns our operations by itself.
00:17:36 [W] And so this will break many of the fighters. For example, you can have volumes were seen as detach from kubernative that in fact a teach and strange letters.
00:17:48 [W] And so this will create errors also are also those tetrapod
00:17:50 [W] Many many things can go wrong.
00:17:52 [W] One of the rarer is that volume for some reason it can be deleted from the street Racers but not from the community is lesser. So as a tremendous users you will see you pee on your PC.
00:18:09 [W] They're ready. They're bound that when you try to attach the PV to you, but you probably never strands because at some point someone something did your volume controls users
00:18:22 [W] So you don't have any information about that just plugs are is a CSI. So you have to be the mean of the operator of the cultures to see these arrows.
00:18:34 [W] One other issue for some maintenance volume could be unavailable for some time and so in the same way that it's a really detailed h-u bird wins simply not start.
00:18:50 [W] They do we know when we do not have any informations because the state is on the storageos circuit in the community structures.
00:19:06 [W] So, you know that anyway as users to have access to slaves and so know how you can fix it when if you can or if you have to try a new room, so you still have to call you the syrup actors. You know what you do?
00:19:15 [W] And the letter one could be an arrow could be to way to go to this errors.
00:19:26 [W] The first way is when you attach all the volume to a wrong and since then basically or if your anticipated Italian stance and so is this phase here is his will let it
00:19:39 [W] Is that when you try to we don't you build another nail that would be an error because the room could be an opponent and do various on two nodes and some time and the other ways because most his
00:19:53 [W] Does not support all the access mode.
00:19:59 [W] I'm going to have 3x smell weed only read-only maybe on read write and write me and most of them does not report with wait many because it's hard to you isolation between those
00:20:11 [W] and so if you start PVC and we tried me, you will not have any errors that when you try to attach the thread refuse the attached and so you are going to this error do
00:20:22 [W] another kind another kind of error are errors around etcd etcd.
00:20:32 [W] It's the brain of your cluster.
00:20:39 [W] If you lost it, for example, your co-star is going to have like a sever case of a saber.
00:20:42 [W] Everything will be the LBC will be running but your cluster won't understand anymore.
00:20:48 [W] What is running what isn't running what should be running so it is this should be well redundant piece of software, but
00:20:56 [W] Default it is a star in one buildpacks machine instance.
00:21:01 [W] Well, it is CD is distributed key-value store.
00:21:11 [W] It can be installed in a distributed way with several is stance on bare metal Italy with the right back up, but it's more complicated.
00:21:17 [W] So you need to understand and to how to operate a tcd how to secularize HD how to backup and restore it is CD before going in production weaveworks.
00:21:24 [W] Kubernative because if you are already in production, and you're at acidophiles, then you are going to have a difficult moment in order to get it back online.
00:21:36 [W] We are going to talk also about security security and kubernative. It is and all the story this peak. It was from Google next two years ago.
00:21:53 [W] It was when the lady began to present it. There was some are a smile in the room because everybody so the problem at the left you have your yugabyte writers muster at the right.
00:22:05 [W] You have a kubernative lost are secure enough to go.
00:22:07 [W] Go into production and all those items. You see there.
00:22:16 [W] There are things to do in order to synchronize your brand new cluster before going to production.
00:22:17 [W] There are many things open port apis exploiter back.
00:22:27 [W] It is difficult, but it is complex many things to do and most things everyday.
00:22:29 [W] We are in going to do here an in-depth view of kubernative security.
00:22:44 [W] We are aiming to give you some small pointers of the biggest point. You should look at why because by default and it isn't it is still true.
00:22:51 [W] It is an as true as some years ago, but by default kubernative is not secure. It is in a bag. It is a feature you can say because
00:22:58 [W] Like this has everything to be secular but by the Fall, although Securities policies of most of them are not you said so your brand new cluster. It is secure the idea behind if you can
00:23:13 [W] Half pretty different security needs even if you are doing the same kind of activity.
00:23:24 [W] So why should we have a very strict security model for sample case that note on it that it is one opinion in this way kubernative least opinionated and you can understand that but
00:23:35 [W] Then if you are going to use it for sensitive things you need to be able to understand a Implement your security policies.
00:23:48 [W] You need to be able to define the security policies of your kubernative other than to your needs and Implement. Then we are going to see only the most basic ones for me.
00:23:59 [W] They are rather similar to the basic security policies of any systems. So Kevin, can you told us?
00:24:05 [W] Some details.
00:24:09 [W] Yes here. We are focusing on two key figures that we should enable to have a minimum security and you can search the default.
00:24:19 [W] The first one is to disable animals out because an animal cells it's bad because you don't have to be authorized to do anything.
00:24:29 [W] first thing is to disable this one and the second parameter the to take care the authorization mode by default it is on
00:24:36 [W] Always alone which implies that also users and you clusters could do anything.
00:24:43 [W] Even if you define our bag back or any security model if you stay with a low or when below at any time.
00:24:49 [W] Then I hope to do dance any systems.
00:25:01 [W] systems. Please close all the access. You don't need all the all the parts that are open, but you are n going to exposed to the internet.
00:25:02 [W] Minimum security and your concerns the default.
00:25:06 [W] The first one is to disable animals out because animals oats it's bad because you don't have to be at the right to do anything. So the first thing is to disable this one and the second parameter the to take care
00:25:08 [W] Actually, it's not needed and closed and only open in a needed basis.
00:25:11 [W] Then Define think undefined your are back your right policy the roles and the access data loss can have please try to limit at the maximum.
00:25:24 [W] They administrator role don't use that for the daily operation of your cluster when it isn't needed a bit like you would do for the root access in your computer then try to define the right
00:25:38 [W] And also in as needed basis if somebody don't need to ask I know they're in port or an external resource.
00:25:50 [W] Please don't give it the right to do it. And of course if you have some sensitive loads it you can always use all the different mechanism in kubernative to insulate as much as possible those sensitive workloads
00:26:03 [W] If you are ready to keep you have a problem with other workloads, you have a hack you can try to limit the problem.
00:26:13 [W] So there are more or less basic rules. But for me the most important one is always keep up to date your kubernative.
00:26:23 [W] There are usually several times a year.
00:26:32 [W] They are a lot of vulnerability that are but every time please look at that follow.
00:26:34 [W] Follow the life cycle of kubernative security. Let's because mirantis is more and more known by company by people with more money used and so it's become a beard beard Target for attack.
00:26:49 [W] So as a pretty key is going to be more users are going to be more deliberately. It's yours.
00:26:58 [W] So you have to take track of them if I am baked or not impact how to mitigate them.
00:27:03 [W] I will fix them.
00:27:06 [W] So this is a daily job. I think plus you have to follow the life cycle.
00:27:11 [W] of the rigid cycle of mirantis which neuvector and every three months. So it's it's really hard to stay up to date but you have to do this.
00:27:17 [W] And even happen after that relax almost everybody is going to get hack-a-thon from times to times.
00:27:28 [W] For example, some two years ago.
00:27:42 [W] There was a very big hug on kubernative cluster at this Le a they have some of the best brains in the industry and they had one cluster that go has got hack and got use it
00:27:44 [W] To mine a keep going keep going and Company keep the currency why a some most things were done by the rules of the art, but there is always one is small hole.
00:27:59 [W] Some random both find it and style and keep commander in the system that got notice when a what is this loaded is running there.
00:28:13 [W] So one last advice of security you maybe we'll get hack with time.
00:28:17 [W] You're almost certainly with get hacked.
00:28:19 [W] Don't try to have some contingency plan backup/restore synchronization in order to be able to get back online after one of these incident.
00:28:29 [W] Don't get confident do all your updates and please try to be sure that if you have a problem you can get back online fast.
00:28:41 [W] So there are many things to be aware before going to production but there are also some good side of kubernative.
00:28:55 [W] Stan can help us in this travel, especially when you are beginning and that's that's one of the very strong point of kubernative.
00:29:02 [W] It is fully modular.
00:29:03 [W] It is fully extensible.
00:29:08 [W] So there are many plugins extensions. You can call them as you want that can help to prepare your kubernative in
00:29:12 [W] Don't need to production.
00:29:16 [W] We are going to talk about three of them for me.
00:29:21 [W] Most basic of then the idea is there are a lot a lot of modules for kubernative. Please look around and before doing something custom in your cluster look around for some time.
00:29:34 [W] I am almost sure that for most of your needs you will find already one problem one product usually cncf project or another that you could add to your kubernative in order to help you instead of coding your custom part.
00:29:49 [W] The first one for me.
00:29:55 [W] It's it's going to be Helm and package manager.
00:30:00 [W] You are doing your first overnight else. You are deploying things where we could control applying lot of yeah, Mel.
00:30:05 [W] Yeah it works.
00:30:11 [W] when you are deploying complexes and detectors you are going to have lots of six to deploy a you can do it with the right level manifest, but your architecture is going to have many moving Parts. How are you going to do?
00:30:21 [W] So for example a roll back to our president version, how are you going to be sure that the new version you have updated our all the concern with elements.
00:30:32 [W] That's the idea of helmet having a package manager and you are going to have helped chart for most of complicated project.
00:30:42 [W] You're going to have your casca Helm shots or gitlab help shot and with the help shirt, you are going to style all the dependencies in the right version and you are going to have
00:30:49 [W] An easy upgrade reproductive health and stars.
00:30:56 [W] It's going to make your life simple, especially with you are beginning similar things for each deal is to have servicemeshcon.
00:31:24 [W] Going to allow you to do complicated things in and you see what I dying service Discovery traffic control encryption prodyna local and Central in upgrades a/b testing and monitoring
00:31:39 [W] With their super graph on a dashboard. So we're going to be eating if you are study schedule cluster you are going to make your life easier and then what you will have enough experience, you won't use maybe Co you will use other
00:31:54 [W] Project but at the beginning is going to make things easier and more sure another one for example is better.
00:32:05 [W] Oh that answer to the question of how you can backup your cluster because yeah you are you have all your luvin file and help shark at that.
00:32:13 [W] You can back up that in a in a git repository for example, but what about the data part and how are your sure that your data backup it in Phase with your
00:32:25 [W] Or purchased and volumes and when you are there are storing everything is going to be back online.
00:32:32 [W] Well Bolero is one product that helps you to do that.
00:32:37 [W] it's going to allow you to back up your configuration and your data from kubernative into any S3s store for example of a swift if you are doing it in a open source way and you can backup all your clothes are part of
00:32:47 [W] You have to schedule it back up. You have backup hook in order to be sure that you are doing all the right step before back up in your database.
00:32:56 [W] For example.
00:32:57 [W] It's a nice product that is going to help you and then in conclusion of this talk, yeah kubenetes easy to begin with it is a really useful for developers and for devops, but it has a price many things to know before.
00:33:13 [W] Go in life with it.
00:33:17 [W] We have seen some of them but only the beginning but our conclusion is that around kubernative. There are three kind of rolls. The cluster operator is the people who installment assign those all the security
00:33:30 [W] Right here for Des CBE Etc.
00:33:34 [W] There is the cluster administrator. The people the person who is going to deploy the I architect or a into the cluster is going to deploy a distributed cluster of Kafka and one gitlab MB wrong, man, and the developer who is going to
00:33:48 [W] Define the deployment for the application defining the email to the docker image the helm shards and deployed application and the skill sets are very different and the operator is a complicated skill set because
00:34:04 [W] They need to know about networking about the Storage security about all these different traps.
00:34:16 [W] But the good news is that many companies don't need to have this operator because they want to use kubernative is today. You are inputting your physical environmental computers in drugs and plug in the network and all
00:34:26 [W] Then I am almost sure you don't need to understand your own kubernative clusters almost any cloud provider we but also our friendly competitors. We have many kubernative solution.
00:34:41 [W] They are all certified.
00:34:45 [W] So anything running in your home kubernative can't run in our money kubernative, but also in Google's in a service coordinators and then you are going to go to get the good side of kubernative without the operation part as I stole.
00:34:56 [W] You there are a lot a lot of them use whatever you want.
00:35:05 [W] We like ours because we have built it with love and we are rather proud of it.
00:35:08 [W] If you want to know more about it.
00:35:10 [W] Please come to our little books after this doll. Can we can discuss about anything you want about kubernative about other products about how going to be production with kubernative and with that?
00:35:23 [W] hope you have liked at our dog. I hope you have learned something and if you have any questions
00:35:26 [W] We are here to answer then.
00:35:29 [W] So thank you very very much.
00:35:30 [W] Thank you.
00:35:32 [W] So I think we are alive now we should be answering the questions.
00:35:50 [W] Yeah, we are live now.
00:35:54 [W] Answer some of the questions you have asked during the talk. The first one we are going to answer is about minikube and about what are the Alternatives or minikube?
00:36:08 [W] There are several question on that because minikube needs lot of ram lot of memory lot of CPU.
00:36:15 [W] So what about the altinity finops?
00:36:22 [W] And you can install it in any computer without any problem and it is also the official solution.
00:36:32 [W] It's made by a kubenetes a special interest group is very beginner friendly, but it is not the only alternative one. And another one we have used is Casey Casey is
00:36:45 [W] It's made by a Rancher k3s.
00:36:48 [W] It's kubernative strip of many of the non essential component. You can say you can easily install it. I small binary it can work on your computer. It can even work in a cluster of
00:37:02 [W] Raspberry Pi minikube Pewters and it is really nice to begin to do the distributed side of kubernative.
00:37:10 [W] for example, but it is a bit more far away from kubernative that minikube so you will have some problems that you don't have in kubernative time. You won't find other problems.
00:37:25 [W] It's a very good solution and it's night to begin to in fact.
00:37:32 [W] Act I usually recommend minikube if you can install it because it is the classic way and k3s if you want to try to install in other computers or in any small cluster of computer.
00:37:46 [W] so next question
00:37:53 [W] Do you do regular packet capturing tools?
00:38:01 [W] Like Wireshark helping the bugging kubernative styra network problems Kevin?
00:38:06 [W] I think you on started this one before.
00:38:07 [W] Yes, I can you repeat the question 3. I was entering variable our packet capturing tools like white shark helping the beginning vitess network problems. Yes.
00:38:23 [W] I really want her to that.
00:38:24 [W] Yes. Sure.
00:38:25 [W] It's helped like to see them.
00:38:31 [W] You have to know is that humanity is running over and networks.
00:38:36 [W] So so when you do TCP dump on your host, you will see packet data encapsulate in the net worth of a lie.
00:38:43 [W] So no matter the time you have to run this be dumped on your new node, but also on your body directly to read keep track of what is going on on the network.
00:38:52 [W] Okay, next one shoot the database run on kubernative.
00:39:01 [W] Well, this one is a controverted questions people has usually a very polarized view of this question.
00:39:10 [W] There are people who love to run everything on kubernative and there are people who detest to put data data applications on kubernative. My view is it can be done, but you need to well understand how
00:39:22 [W] Goodnight, this persistent volumes per system volume strain values drivers work. In in fact, I think in order to run databases in kubernative in production.
00:39:37 [W] You need to have some experience and be sure that everything is going to work.
00:39:42 [W] It can be tricky.
00:39:44 [W] So if you are beginning kubernative, I will suggest you seen an external database or a database as a service and try.
00:39:52 [W] Prions and when you feel sure about it, you can try kubernative databases in production Kevin. Do you agree with me on that or you have another view?
00:40:03 [W] No, it's it's good.
00:40:11 [W] Okay. So next one is for you Kevin.
00:40:15 [W] Do you run kubernative some top of openstack?
00:40:18 [W] Yes.
00:40:19 [W] Yes. We did.
00:40:21 [W] We run key races on top of them and stack with providers the network sister age.
00:40:28 [W] So we use the CSI this intercept iPhone Edwards Foster, right? Sorry and for new clothes views,
00:40:34 [W] The trunk, we also use a lot of bronzers to expose services.
00:40:43 [W] So in fact, we use many liberals as pregnancy stressors as increment is you have service objects, which are objects are used to expose your product
00:40:54 [W] And you have load balancer service kind which I used to expose your bird to the public networks. And so for every the bronzer we use so F5 every service stubborn sir. We
00:41:10 [W] dedicated openstack that burns for instance
00:41:13 [W] Thank you.
00:41:17 [W] Next one Helm Helm set a bit Overkill at what point we should consider using Helm shirt. Well it isn't it true that writing your Helm chart.
00:41:29 [W] It's been rather rather complex on but if you have a complicated application with let's say five ten manifest lot of moving Parts having all that packet in a
00:41:45 [W] And chart can help you to have reproductive.
00:41:54 [W] I'll build in order to deploy a new version without having any problems or doing a clean roll back.
00:41:59 [W] So if you are using complicated description with 510 manifest, I suggest using Helm or any another package manager and I think we are ending now.
00:42:09 [W] Thank you very very much and please if you have any other question couldn't come to our booth at ovhcloud.
00:42:14 [W] Ovhcloud, and we will be there this afternoon to answer all your questions. Thank you very very much.
