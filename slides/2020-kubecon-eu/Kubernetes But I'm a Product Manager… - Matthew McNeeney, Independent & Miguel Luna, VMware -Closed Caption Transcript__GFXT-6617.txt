00:00:17 [W] Hello everyone and Welcome to our presentation for kubernative, but I'm a product manager.
00:04:01 [W] I guess the title says it all and the only plot twist here is that we have tried to make this different by using a poor as opposed to slides.
00:04:11 [W] So first things first, let's begin with introductions.
00:04:16 [W] I'll start with myself.
00:04:20 [W] Let me go. I've been working in product management for over six years.
00:04:23 [W] I'm an Industrial Engineer and worked with Levi strolls along time ago where I got involved with linked techniques, but in the context of physical product manufacturing original context
00:04:35 [W] X of physical product manufacturing original context after that. I work in the UK start up for a number of years and then give cup which is a very popular technique Telco Network in the UK,
00:04:45 [W] Focus on this is where I had my first taste of kubernative migrating from operator chip to eks, and after that I moved to pivotal now BM where I've been working in involving the multi.
00:05:01 [W] That I moved to people Tylenol BM where I've been working in involving the multi cluster lifecycle management of kubernative operators.
00:05:09 [W] OK enough of me is let's hear it from Matt.
00:05:10 [W] Hey everyone.
00:05:11 [W] My name is Matt.
00:05:14 [W] Matt. I started my product management career in 2014 working at different consumer-facing startups. And then I switched over to the enterprise software World joining VMware and spending the last few years working on developer marketplaces for tools.
00:05:25 [W] like Cloud Foundry and kubenetes
00:05:28 [W] Great.
00:05:32 [W] Let's talk about goals for this presentation. When we first landed into kubernative. It took us some time to react to what we were saying given the first definition of kubernative being second trainer
00:05:44 [W] Just landed in Turkey were Nettie's it took us some time to react to what we were saying given the first definition of kubernative being second trainer orchestration solution.
00:05:46 [W] Being a product manager. The first question was a solution to which problems.
00:05:53 [W] Why do we need this?
00:05:53 [W] It is clear that kubernative solve as different problems for different people depending on your context and to help dig out some of these problems.
00:06:08 [W] We will take a product through the different stages of the product life cycle and save some scenarios for how to Burnett is can help at each stage.
00:06:14 [W] The second goal is to gather some ideas on how proud of people can contribute to the kubernative community and mud will take us through this one at the end.
00:06:29 [W] We also have a panty combatant for an agenda for today.
00:06:33 [W] So I'll hand it over to Matt to take us through it and kick it off.
00:06:34 [W] Thanks Miguel.
00:06:36 [W] So let's quickly go over our agenda for today.
00:06:39 [W] We're going to start with talking through the product life cycle and how it can apply to kubelet. He's we'll talk about some product practices yugabyte.
00:06:43 [W] Can apply and then we'll talk about how you can get involved and do a quick Q&A at the end.
00:06:52 [W] The product life cycle concept is more than 50 years old now and for those who are unfamiliar with it, is it essentially describes the four stages every product goes through in this life from introduction and development through growth maturity and finally decline
00:07:03 [W] To go into this concept in any more detail, but there's lots of content easily available online for those who are interested in learning more about each stage or the origin of this framework.
00:07:15 [W] What we do want to do today is take a hypothetical product through each of these stages and share some ideas of how we think kubernative is going to help product teams building products in each of the each stage.
00:07:24 [W] So let's get going.
00:07:27 [W] We're going to start work on a brand new product or initiative.
00:07:28 [W] And so we're in this introduction phase. What should we be thinking about here?
00:07:31 [W] Product teams are software companies need to spend as much time as possible iterating on their applications that are actually deliver value to their customers.
00:07:42 [W] This is especially critical when you're working on something brand-new either at a start-up or larger Enterprise and you need to find product Market fit.
00:07:51 [W] only way to know you're getting closer to this is to work out what you want to learn plan how you're going to measure that and then build and ship the smallest thing that will help you get that learning for those familiar with the Lean Startup this build measure learn Loop will be very familiar.
00:08:06 [W] This is one of the most critical concepts of that movement and your goal as a product manager in a product team is to minimize the amount of time. It takes you to get through each of these stages.
00:08:17 [W] We think there are three different ways in which kubenetes can help you reduce the time. It takes you to get through this Loop.
00:08:19 [W] To really optimize time spent in the build step product teams need to be spending time writing the code that actually delivers value to their users.
00:08:32 [W] The more than half my time.
00:08:35 [W] Just trying to get the basic infrastructure up and running our users never saw this work and there were many things that we ended up over optimizing for because we were scared of having to go back and recreate lots of things later on Paul Engels wrote a great post on medium about you switches experience after
00:08:48 [W] Adopted kubenetes. Their CTO said teams don't realize how much they haven't had to do.
00:08:54 [W] You may have seen a complex modern application visualized using an iceberg before and it's this stuff above the line that your customers truly get value from not the stuff below and so by adopting some of the out of the box features that come with kubenetes product teams can spend more and more time
00:09:10 [W] This water line and get through the build cycle faster.
00:09:14 [W] So, let's assume you build the smallest thing you needed to build to measure and learn from now.
00:09:22 [W] you need to get this into your users hands as quickly as possible. If you've worked in a large Enterprise, you'll no doubt her face long delays in getting your software deployed and available to your users in many organizations.
00:09:33 [W] We've spoken to this is often weeks if not months.
00:09:38 [W] So this is one of the slowest aspects of the build measure learn cycle for many product teams have spoken to historically
00:09:43 [W] GIF gasps Mathias who leads their site reliability engineering an automation teams told us that adopting kubernative has helped them reduce this time down from two weeks to half a day.
00:09:55 [W] This means that product teams are giffgaff can run 20 times more experiments than before and get through the build measure learn leap 20 times faster.
00:10:04 [W] You switch saw something very similar and this graph from the same blog post.
00:10:05 [W] We spoke about a second ago shows you switch tripling their weekly deploys after adopting kubenetes.
00:10:10 [W] And a final point on this one again is especially important when you're starting work on a new product or initiative kubernative has a growing thriving ecosystem right now and many of these open source projects can help you increase your speed through the build measure learn Loop
00:10:26 [W] Ben nominees application catalog on operator Hub to iot you could feasibly get a brand new feature or application built deployed and into your users hands in a matter of hours.
00:10:38 [W] There's rapid experimentation will help you learn what your customers need and help you get to product Market fit faster.
00:10:43 [W] Okay. So let's assume, you know, we built a built a reasonable product. We've got through this introduction phase and we're starting to get into the exciting growth phase Miguel. What should we be thinking about here?
00:10:56 [W] Thank you bot.
00:10:59 [W] We're not growing and he's great.
00:11:06 [W] There's a junior even thinking about expanding your business to other geographies.
00:11:14 [W] Someone talk to you about all the great benefits of containers and you think great I just have to put my application in a container and is fully portable.
00:11:21 [W] However, as more explained in the iceberg analogy, there is always something below the water level and it is wise to have a quick exploration to avoid surprises.
00:11:25 [W] That said let's talk about portability and what could be interesting for product managers?
00:11:32 [W] If you look at this guy here struggling is to give you an idea of all the concepts and application developer needs to understand.
00:11:45 [W] I'm used to run at single containerize application effectively in kubernative.
00:11:47 [W] Day 2 operations, which I don't even know much of myself
00:12:01 [W] I'm not even suggesting that product managers need to understand alternative Concepts, but it is good to get a glimpse and understand what portability really mean for kubernative.
00:12:12 [W] And because you're in a stage of growth is the perfect time to set the foundation of your portability. How you plan on working with all these Yama even when you are even bigger.
00:12:28 [W] We ask this question to Matias from gift card. I how you deploy a gift cards tomorrow somewhere else.
00:12:33 [W] Not sure why he picked Ohio by his answer was very insightful.
00:12:39 [W] The key to portability is infrastructure as code. In other words it you said your foundations right then.
00:12:45 [W] Blowing man in another area country or continent will be easy.
00:12:48 [W] However, you have to remember that during this stage.
00:12:52 [W] You're still experimenting with a limb with the limb mindset that might mention trying to prove and disprove many hypotheses and you need to move fast in inexpensive ways to learn what you need to learn.
00:13:05 [W] So what do you do?
00:13:06 [W] Luckily, there are many flavors of kubernative available to help you make a decision based on your particular circumstances.
00:13:15 [W] Many you don't have to spend too much time up from sitting up in price a code before deciding to Arnett is the solution the right solution for you.
00:13:26 [W] Some of these opinionated kubernative can be an accelerator, but it's important to remember that you are sacrificing portability and you need to be aware of how far you can go into these Solutions before you get locked in.
00:13:41 [W] If your goal is to move between clouds freely, for example, you might want to ignore a cloud specific service and consider going up a liar a layer of abstraction to deploy your application to a solution that is clouded Gnostic as an
00:13:57 [W] If your goal is to move between clouds freely, for example, you might want to ignore a cloud specific service and consider going up a liar a layer of abstraction to deploy your application to a solution that is clouded Gnostic as an
00:13:58 [W] Cloud and Gnostic solution in VMware. You might want to have a look at the talent show application service.
00:14:03 [W] For kubernative which you can deploy across multiple clouds.
00:14:09 [W] So that's all for the growth scenario Matt.
00:14:13 [W] Why don't we move this product into the maturity stage?
00:14:13 [W] So you've launched this brand new product and you've grown into a huge success.
00:14:20 [W] That's awesome.
00:14:25 [W] But at some point in time, the inevitable will happen and your product will reach the mature stage.
00:14:28 [W] This is especially prevalent in Enterprises where long support contracts the common and in this stage of the life cycle. Your goal is to continue delivering value to your existing customers as finding ways to increase your profits often through reducing your costs
00:14:40 [W] Been to many many organizations who have really struggled with the first part of this goal.
00:14:53 [W] How do you continue innovating and delivering more value when you're suddenly competing for resources across multiple projects and other new initiatives and this is hard, especially if within a short space of time you've gone from say 10 to 10,000 developers
00:15:00 [W] Can't offer this gold.
00:15:08 [W] There are likely many ways you could do this, but one place we've seen kubernative really help is in reducing your infrastructure costs.
00:15:10 [W] So let's take a brief look into each of these bits.
00:15:17 [W] So you've grown to 10,000 developers. They work in awesome product teams trying to accelerate through the build measure learn cycle and they're wanting to deploy tens of times every day, but your operations and security teams are in a lot of pain.
00:15:26 [W] Risk of things breaking and they're reluctant to let product teams make all of these changes. What do you do?
00:15:32 [W] The best organizations we've spoken to who managed to consistently innovator this kind of scale have all adopted platform as a product principles.
00:15:45 [W] This means that you treat the platform that your product teams use everyday as a product in its own right and one that is incredibly important in delivering value to all of your customers.
00:15:52 [W] The destination here is the kind of experience is tools like Heroku and Cloud Foundry give developers one button deploys in a safe and secure way that meet the needs of both the product teams and the Operations Security and audit teams many companies are building.
00:16:06 [W] help bring the kubenetes and platform is a product worlds together helping product teams get kubernative clusters that meet the needs of their security and compliance teams with things like logging metrics all ready to go in the second minutes or even less right
00:16:22 [W] Weeks. This is a huge Topic in its own right? But if you feel like you want to learn more about this, if you just search Google for tons of platform as a product, then you'll find a great white paper on this.
00:16:34 [W] Now let's quickly look at a couple of examples of modern companies successfully using kubernative to reduce their infrastructure costs first, let's jump back to giffgaff again and read this great quote.
00:16:49 [W] The automation team owns the platform.
00:16:51 [W] We provide a platform as a service to other teams will cluster scales up and down automatically.
00:16:54 [W] So with 3 a.m.
00:16:59 [W] When services are idle it shrinks at 3:00 p.m. The sides very busy.
00:17:00 [W] scales up before kubernative. We can do this. We treated VMS like pets
00:17:04 [W] Seeing how much capacity we needed for peak times and we over-allocated 90% of the time. Anyway, the built-in features of kubernative means that they no longer need to bet what capacity they need for peak times like Black Friday and can instead save that money by only using the capacity
00:17:20 [W] Black Friday and can instead save that money by only using the capacity. They need all of the BT from munzo a challenger bank here in the UK wrote a great blog post about how the Monza team were using kubernative to build a highly available Bank from the ground up.
00:17:31 [W] System they've built to do this runs on kubenetes and as this graph shows has drastically reduced the cost of the infrastructure after a quick initial investment.
00:17:43 [W] One of the clever examples the Monza team talk about here is how they now run their High usage build jobs using spare capacity and their existing infrastructure, which is basically free.
00:17:51 [W] Alright, so going back to the product life cycle graph.
00:17:58 [W] Let's say we've got through this maturity phase and again the inevitable happens. We move into decline Miguel what happens here?
00:18:04 [W] So there are many reasons that could account for a declining product.
00:18:12 [W] But in this scenario, we will assume customer satisfaction is down because of poor service levels this call from the team that wrote the Google SRE book is key to help us understand how to prioritize
00:18:24 [W] So it reads customer happiness is a rather fuzzy concept. We can measure it precisely our experience has shown that a hundred percent reliability is the wrong target.
00:18:34 [W] of course, you want a hundred percent customer satisfaction, but acknowledging that a hundred percent service level is the wrong goal will help us avoid wasted investment because even when redundant components automated Health
00:18:50 [W] There's still a small probability that something will pale simultaneously and you will not achieve this hundred percent Target assuming you could hypothetically achieve a hundred percent reliability.
00:19:06 [W] There is a complex chain of components between you and your customers so they will not experience a hundred percent.
00:19:12 [W] Let's now talk about the famous lines of service levels.
00:19:17 [W] as you go from two nines 239 even to the mythical five nines each extra nine comes out an increased cost to give you an idea three nines give you a down time of eight point seven seven hours per year,
00:19:34 [W] Same allowed on time downtime goes down, too.
00:19:45 [W] 26 minutes with just two extra lines. Just speak to the investment required to get to this level.
00:19:46 [W] due to the constraints from other lamp elements in the chain the real benefit to your customers produces exponentially until it reaches almost zero regardless of how much you keep investing and you need to consider the
00:20:02 [W] Source of outages exchange pushing new features applying security patches deploy new hardware and scaling up to meet customer demand.
00:20:15 [W] This means that you will reduce how much your update or improve your service and sooner or later.
00:20:18 [W] It will stagnate and your product will inevitably decline.
00:20:21 [W] so how is this related to kubernative you may ask Engineers are as card resource, even at the largest largest organizations engineering time should be invested in the most important characteristics of the most important services
00:20:37 [W] I can the right balance between investing in functionality that will grow your customer base versus investing in the reliability and scalability that will keep existing customers happy is difficult.
00:20:52 [W] This is where the automation of kubernative controllers for example can help us releasing some of that engineering time.
00:21:02 [W] You could even decide to go beyond and extend kubernative using the operator pattern which will allow you to automate many of the human operations.
00:21:07 [W] And releasing Engineers from them. So as product managers, it is your responsibility to bring to the team enough information from what is valuable to customers and help them make a decision as to what is the best way to invest their time.
00:21:23 [W] Was product managers it is your responsibility to bring to the team enough information from what is valuable to customers and help them make a decision as to what is the best way to invest their time striking the right balance
00:21:26 [W] Striking the right balance between managing reliability and improving your product.
00:21:29 [W] Right. So that's it for the product life cycle mad what I'm you this, how about what do we do a quick check on the agenda topics?
00:21:40 [W] All right.
00:21:42 [W] Thanks Miguel's.
00:21:45 [W] So if we quickly jump back over to our agenda then hopefully we can mark this their product life cycle in kubenetes card is done, which is awesome.
00:21:57 [W] So next up on our agenda is Miguel's going to talk to us about how we can apply some product practices to this world over to you Miguel.
00:22:01 [W] Okay, so we have taken our product through four different scenarios.
00:22:11 [W] I'm show you how kubernative could help during Age, but it's time for the fun part the stuff we're now talking product.
00:22:18 [W] So let's play around with some product practices.
00:22:24 [W] We have a hand-picked some important objectives that came up load during the project stages exercise your customers might say they want a speed as in performance.
00:22:30 [W] Price price price which is tied to your capital and operational expenditure.
00:22:35 [W] Service is key as we discuss reliability reliability is required to unexpected level or they simply want it. Now timing is important as you might have the perfect solution but it is no ready when your customers need it then it will be
00:22:51 [W] But before we make some uninformed prioritization, let's say the scenario, which may help us do more than just guessing.
00:23:01 [W] So your product is web hosting for geocities.
00:23:07 [W] I hope someone remembers the city was a long long time ago.
00:23:13 [W] So your company has position your body proposition as being the pastor's hosting reliable know the three nines here and also a big differentiator is 1 pound a year.
00:23:25 [W] After speaking with stakeholders analyzing the data from customers.
00:23:33 [W] You want to take some actions on a boat that product decline.
00:23:36 [W] So you hold a workshop and starting rank how pressing the Improvement of these outcomes is for your customers reliability comes last as it seems like 390 is good in terms of service levels for them.
00:23:47 [W] Spirit second and prizes the most right most of the right here to identify as the most valuable aspect for your customer value.
00:23:57 [W] So given that price was chosen your team has decided exploring how to reduce price by reducing operational expenditure.
00:24:07 [W] To help phrase outcomes without including Solutions.
00:24:31 [W] So we take the proposed how my with and we rank them according to perceived impact and effort by using one of the most well-known and probably my favorite protection framework the in purposes for Matrix.
00:24:40 [W] So you want to look in that upper right quadrant where the least effort made the most impact in this scenario. We can say that you're thin things that releasing engineering time and avoiding vendor lock-in are in that sweet spot
00:24:54 [W] Oh, please please effort and more impact.
00:24:59 [W] There are many way many ways and many other Frameworks that to get to this product realization. But the important aspect is to get your team to narrow their focus giving them alignment in what you're trying to achieve.
00:25:12 [W] Right. So now we move on to the fun part and the engineers favorite Solutions.
00:25:19 [W] We want to do an ideation session to answer that question of how my we release some engineering time you allow your team to diverge and have some personal thinking to come up with potential Solutions.
00:25:35 [W] In this case. Your team has suggesting different options. Like someone said, oh, why don't we do Cannery releases to reduce the risk of breaking breaking up things upon release.
00:25:46 [W] Another person said, let's build a kubernative operator and automate these operations which take a lot of time.
00:25:50 [W] Furthermore lesra platform X application to kubernative and that way we leverage on the kubenetes automation instead of having to be on call to restart this up every time it crushes and finally someone said, oh, why don't
00:26:06 [W] Just to reduce the risk of breaking up breaking up things upon release.
00:26:07 [W] Another person said let's build a kubernative operator and automate these operations which take a lot of time furthermore.
00:26:08 [W] Let's reply from X application to kubernative and that way we leverage on the kubernative out to mation instead of having to be on call to restart this up every time it crashes and finally someone said, oh, why don't we just create a to LinkedIn?
00:26:09 [W] So from all these Solutions your team can start experimenting.
00:26:17 [W] It does not mean that you go has down for six months and build something. I encourage you to take the link approach Eileen approaching to it experiments that might give you leading indicators of whether the solution should
00:26:27 [W] Your team can start experimenting.
00:26:28 [W] It does not mean that you go has down for six months and build something. I encourage you to take the link approach a lean approach into it experiments that might give you leading indicators or whether the solution should
00:26:28 [W] Well, that's all for practices. I'll give it back to Mike to check how we're doing right things and do the final section.
00:26:37 [W] Yes, hopefully we've managed to achieve our goals and demonstrating how we believe kubernative can help product managers and product teams.
00:26:47 [W] No matter what stage of the product life cycle.
00:26:48 [W] They're working in and also where some useful product practices can help to finish off.
00:26:57 [W] We want to quickly go through a getting involved section then finally a QA.
00:27:03 [W] So we promised we talked about how a product people can get in more involved in the community.
00:27:06 [W] But to be honest, this is where we think we need your help. There used to be a product management.
00:27:08 [W] She'll interest group but that no longer exists and we're not really sure where product folks tend to hang out in this community.
00:27:23 [W] But we'd love to find out we really do think that kubenetes is a transformative technology and this applies to product management equally as it does to software engineering and we think some awesome things could be done by bringing these worlds close together. And so we'd love
00:27:29 [W] You can either hang around now and ask us some questions or alternatively if you'd like to give feedback on your own time if you head over to bit Dolly, / but I'm a PM with hyphens.
00:27:42 [W] You can leave your feedback.
00:27:45 [W] They're speaking from Miguel and myself.
00:27:47 [W] It's been a pleasure speaking with you all today.
00:27:49 [W] I hope you found this somewhat useful and over to you all for any questions, which we can try and answer.
00:27:54 [W] All right.
00:28:01 [W] Hey Miguel.
00:28:03 [W] Thanks for joining everyone.
00:28:07 [W] And hopefully you can see there should be a box to ask some questions in this tool alternatively as soon as this is over.
00:28:17 [W] We'll be jumping into the slack channel for the community, which is 2 - Cube Khan - community.
00:28:19 [W] So also feel free to ask questions there.
00:28:23 [W] We do have one that's come in or a few that's come into the chat so far actually two of the same question and one from Philip asking.
00:28:28 [W] With these slides made and from Dominic saying what do you use for their presentation tool?
00:28:35 [W] McAllister's your your brainchild?
00:28:36 [W] So you tell us tell us how we made this.
00:28:42 [W] So it is mirror which was formally call as Fair as real-time board.
00:28:50 [W] You used me a room pretty much you can zoom in zoom out and that's kind of like what we wanted to get to where we wanted to talk to you about one aspect and resuming into it.
00:29:00 [W] Lies and then there was a little bit of editing on the back of that which hopefully you didn't see or the all the glitches between because this was definitely all done in one take the next question. That's come in.
00:29:18 [W] Is there a cube PM's Community?
00:29:21 [W] Maybe I can take a stab at this one as I mentioned just at the end there that used to be a special interest group and just around product management by think that that's gone away.
00:29:31 [W] like that to be one. I know again.
00:29:34 [W] Crazy to both this week in talking to Community Channel after this but there's Miguel's also created a cube Khan - product Channel and slack.
00:29:46 [W] We'd love your ideas their kitchen. So if you do have any it'll be great to hear them.
00:29:51 [W] them. Hopefully there's a lot of product people in this in the communities Community who we can bounce ideas off.
00:29:53 [W] All right.
00:29:55 [W] I'll take this one day from criticcar Rush as a product manager.
00:30:03 [W] Is there any material that I can use to learn more about it?
00:30:06 [W] The ones available now are mostly engineer Focus.
00:30:07 [W] Well, this is actually like one of the main reasons why we created this talk and in fact like to encourage product managers to understand and get more involved in the community.
00:30:21 [W] I don't believe that you will find like a holy grail of one material that will
00:30:25 [W] You I like that would be like, okay. They this is everything you need to know but there are many many things like product that practices that you currently have can be applied into any context of cloud and I don't
00:30:38 [W] My what do you think as well?
00:30:43 [W] Where where have you found like interesting thing for product managers?
00:30:44 [W] I think I found the same as you it's it's quite hard, especially at the start when you first start looking because he say a lot of it is engineering focused like the way I got to grips with. It was just like I did follow some of those tutorials. Just you know,
00:31:00 [W] That the world's best developer by a country mile, but at least it gave me a kind of some understanding of like what it was for and then kind of I can I started trying to work out ways to extrapolate from there and be like, okay.
00:31:15 [W] Well, how should I talk about this within my team to our customers to our kind of cross-functional Partners in the organization and things like this.
00:31:26 [W] are some blog posts out there since McKeldin is called his own blog post that I will Miguel Rojo great one which kind of looks like kubernative but within like the using like a cookie store,
00:31:30 [W] As the Khan is like a good concept to talk about it and I'll post it in that are in there too - coupon - Community Channel as soon as mmm we've done this QA so but I think that's worth the read.
00:31:40 [W] All right. I got another one from Peru car. You want to go for it at one month?
00:31:47 [W] How to Advocate kubermatic to the developer team.
00:31:54 [W] Yeah. That's that's a very good question.
00:31:55 [W] My experience with this was kind of almost the opposite way round, like kubenetes was an idea that I came up through the development team and the more they were like singing the Praises of what some of this technology could do.
00:32:11 [W] We then obviously and we were going to in an organization which which is a lot of a lot of big Enterprise customers and we were also hearing it from that side to saying hey there seems to be this like huge wave coming called kubenetes.
00:32:23 [W] I'm how can we best make use of that to be a faster leaner more agile organization? And so I think we
00:32:26 [W] From a place where there was like quite a lot of advocacy from both sides and it was our job to really start trying to realize.
00:32:32 [W] Okay.
00:32:37 [W] What do we do with this technology? And how can we both for ourselves and our customers help realize the benefits of those McHale Chief anything to add on that one?
00:32:46 [W] No, I think that that's pretty well cover can actually reading one from Dominic now it says
00:32:53 [W] I'm working on a platform team and helping quite some application application team.
00:33:05 [W] I observed that the knowledge of the POS varies a lot any tips ideas how I could gently push the less knowledgeable people to get more into it from my child. I will say
00:33:09 [W] From one of the things that the product managers want to know is why you're doing things. So if you approach it immediately as this is the solution if you try to pair it with the solution to which problem that could really go a long way so it's always
00:33:24 [W] It would be a good idea to apart from it.
00:33:31 [W] There is also like the use have analogies as one of my favorite like my were saying that blog that I wrote about a cookie store is such an analogy based on kubenetes to get those people that if you kind of like immediately if you draw the if you
00:33:44 [W] If you take those people in into an architectural diagram from kubernative straight away that probably like will be too much of a job.
00:33:59 [W] So bring them in slowly like with analogies and understanding like what is the problem that you're solving a wider net is could be the right solution for you anything about that you want to add?
00:34:06 [W] No, I think that that generally covers my Approach. I think I like II feel this pain and it is sometimes hard especially when you kind of use them a lot of them all.
00:34:13 [W] Like technical engineering Focus kubenetes language analogy is like really help right just like I was just like any kind of Storytelling and that's not always easy.
00:34:24 [W] Hopefully you like over time they'll be more and more content out there available for product folks to make that make that job easier one thing I quickly pick up in the channel because there's a couple more questions about this about the slack channel name.
00:34:36 [W] Sorry. I did that bit quickly earlier.
00:34:42 [W] So the channel is hashtag to - Cube Khan -
00:34:43 [W] A I do believe just as this Q&A finishes shortly that might pop up on the screen as well as well be written down just in case it doesn't that's hashtag to the number 2 - cubic on - community.
00:34:58 [W] And the other channel that you mention was the cube Khan - product that is just for the conversation that might say like maybe like if we want to take you further further ahead.
00:35:11 [W] All right.
00:35:18 [W] Do we have more questions popping up?
00:35:23 [W] I'm actually gonna ask one question to you. My like, how did you you know, it's a p.m.
00:35:26 [W] Where was your first days of your net is how did you get involved?
00:35:27 [W] How did you manage to ramp up your knowledge?
00:35:29 [W] I think I started and I and some more and fortune in terms of like I have a technical background and so, you know, I'm relatively comfortable jumping into things like a command line.
00:35:45 [W] I know that's not everyone and that's just like one route into product management.
00:35:52 [W] It did enable me to kind of just actually install kubenetes and start playing around with it. And then I kind of like built my way up from there, which is One path that takes a while though.
00:35:59 [W] Like I definitely for a few months was like, oh my gosh, what am I even looking at here? So it
00:36:00 [W] Took a little bit of time to get kind of the level.
00:36:03 [W] wanted to be at you probably a different experience Miguel. What was yours?
00:36:06 [W] So mine was like yeah at the beginning very similar into one of them.
00:36:18 [W] I mean probably like they similar part was oh my God. What am I looking at here?
00:36:23 [W] I tried to do like many tutorials and Hands-On stuff.
00:36:35 [W] I will happen is that a lot of them were very walked through like very kind of like click here click there. And at the end I kind of I had a kubernative posters up and running but a lot of the commands that I have that I had.
00:36:37 [W] I didn't know what they were actually doing. So what I take the approach that I took was like I wrote an article and started iterating on it and bounce right back with Engineers with people that were more knowledgeable.
00:36:53 [W] So using that the power of those analogies to see if I was understanding things, right and it was great because we kind of brought us to a middle ground where they could tell me.
00:37:08 [W] No, that's not how you think of this but perhaps you could create the analogy this way and that helped that went a long way forward to getting to a middle ground of conversation. When wasn't too technical for me to go like I have no idea what these procedures
00:37:19 [W] mention or for them to pinball it to kind of like feel like I wanted everything like to
00:37:29 [W] Into into a very like layman terms awesome.
00:37:39 [W] Okay, I think that's a any questions yet, please do as I said before there is that and there is that bitly the bit Dell y / but - I'm - a - p n if you want to leave as an anonymous feedback, that's
00:37:52 [W] It if not, we'll be hanging around in slack now.
00:37:57 [W] So yeah, thank you.
00:37:59 [W] I there I just see it pop up.
00:37:59 [W] That's great.
00:38:01 [W] So, yeah.
00:38:01 [W] thank you again for joining today means a lot to me.
00:38:06 [W] I'm sure it means a lot to you Miguel as well great to speak with you all and hopefully we'll continue this conversation now.
