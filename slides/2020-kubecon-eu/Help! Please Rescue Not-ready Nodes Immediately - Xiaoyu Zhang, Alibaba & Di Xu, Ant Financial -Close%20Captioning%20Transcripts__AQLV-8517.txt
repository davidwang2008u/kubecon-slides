00:01:03 [W] Hello, everyone. Nice to come here to share some of your parents about her connected to operation as you.
00:01:42 [W] Hello, everyone. Nice to come here to share some of you parents about her connected to operation as you see from the topic.
00:07:07 [W] We will bring you some cases about would it be should do when Rook notary is down and the summary we concluded from how to recovery. He has a node this topic partly based on community projector.
00:07:19 [W] Any para Pasar our further Advance the Improvement?
00:07:23 [W] Now I want to introduce us firstly my partner tissue from and group.
00:07:33 [W] I'm sure Joan from Tenzin crowd.
00:07:35 [W] Both of us are cognates member and very active in community contribution.
00:07:44 [W] We are various a try to use the latest circle of knative technology in our work.
00:07:47 [W] Here is our agent firstly we will introduce a common cast which is not already node. Then introduce an open source project.
00:08:04 [W] The fat has in its name is MBD short for no problem detector besides. We also introduced a new system. We called not self healing by using those tools.
00:08:15 [W] We would want to share some listen. We learn and start some discuss.
00:08:19 [W] Laster draw a conclusion of this topic
00:08:23 [W] new discovery the terminal shoe not is not really like this picture.
00:08:32 [W] What should we do next to deal with this?
00:08:42 [W] We should firstly make the reason of no problem with people but invest like checking no status lost Magics and then try to reduce better notes.
00:08:48 [W] Then ready again.
00:08:51 [W] But how to make the program visible quickly here, we produced a community project and BD the deploy is still my agent.
00:09:07 [W] He already noted and reported detailed. He the result of Purity not a problem is reported as null condition or even jh9 condition is permanent program Mac the No Doubt available such as
00:09:21 [W] Kennedy lock the Kong better disc
00:09:27 [W] event is temporary problem by the informed him such as om cute.
00:09:36 [W] Only detecting problem cannot meet our zettaset vacation.
00:09:45 [W] We want to fix the hairs in order as soon as possible.
00:09:47 [W] We need other operators along side of his MBD to help you Discovery and fix the problem.
00:09:55 [W] Look at the picture with design. We add some components.
00:09:59 [W] Not exemption is the customer source definition which telepresence of the natural node resource.
00:10:08 [W] Palm Bay the disc
00:10:20 [W] event is temporary problem but informative such as om cute.
00:10:20 [W] Only detecting problem cannot meet adversities vacation. We want to fix the hairs in order as soon as possible.
00:10:21 [W] We need the other operators alongside of with MPD to help with Discovery and fix problem.
00:10:23 [W] Look at the picture.
00:10:23 [W] with design. We add some components.
00:10:24 [W] Nautica tension is the customer source definition which telepresence of the natural node resource.
00:10:26 [W] MPD will report the result to not a detention configure is the map of repair mortar and program conditions. Another pair agent has many Beauty in
00:10:27 [W] Burma conditions another pair agent has many Beauty in repair shares.
00:10:28 [W] Vader work the not extension conditions are has it'll be a stud self-heating by running specified the scripts.
00:10:38 [W] But which kinds of a problem should be a tensioned? Let's D3 share his experience.
00:10:50 [W] Normally the problems could be worried from Hardware to software here. We have divided them into below three groups Hardware system software runtime hardware issues really include physical disk problem.
00:11:08 [W] That's what issues discussed how exaggerate exaggerate here. We have alone a list of few common problems for system software O's kernel bug is usually the most frequent one and lower rotatory be another one that would
00:11:23 [W] Total disk for in our company about six percent of the problems that caused by runtime such as dog cam with saying runtime circuit exaggerator.
00:11:35 [W] This is a configuration llamo for our non-problem detector.
00:11:47 [W] Actually, this llamo is quite long.
00:11:49 [W] I only take part of it here.
00:11:55 [W] We'll divide defined two groups of policies.
00:11:57 [W] Why is for monitoring Docker? The other is monitoring colonel?
00:12:00 [W] That's deep dive to see some sample plugins here. We have use prepared check the check ft binary to periodically check the amount of the be used if it exists at
00:12:20 [W] We'll be updating it to another status.
00:12:23 [W] Let's see the rights of picture.
00:12:27 [W] Another simple plug-in is about inode.
00:12:34 [W] This will be quite a useful before the system.
00:12:35 [W] I know the get exhausted, especially when you pull the uses host past rolling and creates too many photos by externally.
00:12:49 [W] actually. We need to write some remedies trips to fix these issues were detecting them.
00:12:51 [W] But mostly those wrap these scripts are written in Shell to Manning cotton causes you to be considered. It is very hard to maintain the scripts and keep every fix attempted.
00:13:08 [W] The most difficult part will be the complex in the dependency.
00:13:13 [W] It is hard split the issues apart and it helped find out to Outer which one is the root cause and which ones should be resolved first.
00:13:23 [W] Here I want to have some discussions.
00:13:31 [W] For the deployment of the detector and the repairing urgent.
00:13:37 [W] Normally there are two ways.
00:13:41 [W] Why is through IPM or Debian packages?
00:13:44 [W] upgrading effort
00:13:52 [W] since the repairing scripts and the detecting plugging will be change it frequently and it's hard to have a static strategy to manage this.
00:14:04 [W] And we use config map to start our strategies as well.
00:14:10 [W] The last one is a resource. Oh has about BD.
00:14:16 [W] If you have included too many plugins in your agent, please limit the resource of your demon seed pod.
00:14:25 [W] Actually in the community plan Labs have open source the product Nev the dry now.
00:14:37 [W] Which were out of which will automatically condom and join Community knows best down not conditions.
00:14:46 [W] You can say it's configurable jump buffer time.
00:14:55 [W] And this is a general will automatically transfer evic support one by one. It is very safe. You can see the below events.
00:15:03 [W] Which will automatically condom and join Community knows best down not conditions.
00:15:21 [W] You can say it configurable Jen buffer time.
00:15:22 [W] And this is a general will automatically translate X approach one by one it is very safe. You can see the below events.
00:15:23 [W] Here is what we want to address in every station last actually the repairing scripts another universally valid in any verse structure.
00:15:25 [W] That's why we have not taken too much time on how we fix the issues.
00:15:26 [W] There is no silver bullets to fix her nose, as you know unions have your own secret menu.
00:15:34 [W] The most important rule we have got is kiss keep your infrastructure simple and standard.
00:15:43 [W] It will be much more convenient to fix your notes.
00:15:47 [W] Thanks for coming to our session. Feel free to peanuts on Slack.
00:15:59 [W] sounds like
