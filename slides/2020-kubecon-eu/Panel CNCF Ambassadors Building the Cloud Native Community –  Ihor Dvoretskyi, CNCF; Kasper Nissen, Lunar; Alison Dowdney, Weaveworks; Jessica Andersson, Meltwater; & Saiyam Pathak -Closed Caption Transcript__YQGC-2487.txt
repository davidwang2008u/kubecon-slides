00:06:34 [W] I work as a team lead for our engineering and development team, which is an internet platform people at small start-up in Gothenburg called on until I'm also cncf Ambassador mostly because of the work that I do as a meet-up organizer for kubernative near the
00:06:35 [W] Right where it's more of a general cncf made up, but it's called kubernative because I was was the most coal when we started out.

00:07:26 [W] Yeah, hello everyone and thank you for joining. I am a software engineer working at Walmart labs and my Twitter handle is a dress. I am perturbed. I am cncf Ambassador.

00:07:57 [W] Thanks.
00:07:58 [W] awesome.
00:08:02 [W] Casper you mentioned it you and Lucas you being the co-founders of the knoteks community.
00:08:11 [W] So can you please describe for us how heavy is how we could get started with building a community.
00:08:20 [W] So what was the reason why they've started building that the deaf community and deaf local community at all?
00:08:22 [W] Yeah, so so both Lucas and I started local and sort of the cities that we are sort of based in and and just we were both passionate about this new technology and it was pretty early on I did some work with communities
00:08:37 [W] My masterpieces as well and I just wanted to work with communities and cloudevents.
00:09:07 [W] He's and then at some point Lucas and I were sort of discussing back and forth.
00:09:21 [W] Why not try to to help each other as much as possible in the nordics as well and try to create I think we call it a meet-up Alliance.
00:09:26 [W] So just a group of meet up organizers Jessica included think we are 13 groups at the moment kind of hard right now at the corona pandemic and all that.
00:09:35 [W] been trying to do some online stuff as well, but that's sort of
00:09:39 [W] We got started.
00:09:40 [W] It was just passionate about our knative and wanted to share our experiences and yeah found each other and then and spread it to the entire audience.
00:09:48 [W] Awesome, Jessica.
00:09:55 [W] I know that you are also based in audix. You're based in Sweden and getting work, right? So what was your story?
00:09:57 [W] Well, so I have always been interested in like containerd based Solutions and I was pretty much involved in the docker Meetup Group when it started in Gothenburg and a few years back.
00:10:13 [W] I started melt water which had I use a branding several containers in a distributed microservices architecture and until this spring I was on the team that was the team providing that and we based on you. We're running this Marathon.
00:10:28 [W] but in the beginning and we were going to upgrade Arch and you containerless tekton tooling and we chose kubernative and was really fun to set it up from the start and we learned so many different things so it became kind of natural to want to share that because we had to fight a lot to get
00:10:42 [W] I wish we needed to build that and we felt like we learn so many valuable things.
00:10:47 [W] We want to share with everyone else.
00:10:55 [W] So me and my team we were reading Bolding the community and it just felt very natural to be more involved as an organizer as well.
00:11:02 [W] So that's how I started doing it and then I got in touch with Casper and Lucas and we started building the cloud native nordics and it's been really fun and it's such a great Community to be part of it.
00:11:10 [W] Perfect.
00:11:11 [W] Awesome.
00:11:13 [W] So let's flip to another set of the world Allison.
00:11:15 [W] How about here?
00:11:17 [W] The so in terms of organizing made up some things.
00:11:30 [W] I will be honest of everyone here. I don't have heaps of experience with that.
00:11:31 [W] But what I do have experience in is bringing together people online asynchronously as a community for like things like you contributor Workshop that we're currently working
00:11:45 [W] Getting on building in second Trebek's so yeah.
00:11:52 [W] That's kind of my background.
00:11:56 [W] Yeah, it's perfect.
00:11:57 [W] It's a good it's a good sample of how do we have people in the ambassador's community who are not only Demeter pronounces, but you know some different work around the globe and around echo system. So before we move to say
00:12:11 [W] Um, I have one question to say I'm so proximately half a year ago my last my last international business trip was to India to speak at their local competitors kubenetes forums.
00:12:26 [W] Probably one of the biggest communities events that have ever happened to Mania and I was sort of a surprise to him for as by a number of people who are working in the industry there who are mentioned about in chlorinated apology. So, I'm really curious to hear your
00:12:40 [W] Re and your background, but how how do you handle it myself?
00:12:47 [W] of whereas people of multiple people probably thousands of people who are interested in building a trident that clone knative ecosystem in India.
00:12:57 [W] Yeah, so the cloudevents go system is growing very rapidly and India and all the states.
00:13:04 [W] I would say but I will talk only specifically about Bangalore where it all spare my journey started so it started back approximately two years back when I was attending doctor meetups and the things were picking paste and yes
00:13:19 [W] Taco meat that's what really powerful.
00:13:21 [W] I mean they were full packed and we used to you know have full registrations Full House.
00:13:31 [W] So with that I started attending then slowly slowly. I submitted a cfp and I was one of the speakers over there and I started then contributing back to back back to bat speaking sessions and slowly I realized yes the community making
00:13:42 [W] Also, I mean very good.
00:13:56 [W] So I started all the new tech meetups the rancher in flux cncf. All these meetups were started and then we had a lot of audience who actually were willing to attend and learn these texts.
00:13:59 [W] So with that I did I mean I started organizing the meetups area check out to specific organizations and finding of the speaker's all that stuff.
00:14:08 [W] I mean, it really excites me and I mean, I would continue doing that and building more.
00:14:12 [W] great community of life
00:14:14 [W] Awesome, another question to you.
00:14:20 [W] say I'm so how do you find the meet up for free or medium square meter Square local events and so on.
00:14:24 [W] So finally the Meetup is like we usually find all the meetups where they meet up.com and all the social media platform is very important played very important over here.
00:14:41 [W] So you keep an eye on Twitter.
00:14:51 [W] So we initially how we do is like we post any of the meat up immediately post out on Twitter. So it should have a couple of weeks.
00:14:52 [W] will believe it or not. It should be not like you are planning on Monday that you'll be given immediate.
00:14:56 [W] Up on Saturday, so it should not be like that.
00:15:00 [W] Get ample enough sample of time for organizing a beta. So you have a you have a title you have certain set of process that is happening in the background and you have certain set of marketing that is getting done.
00:15:14 [W] done. So that people can know like this is happening and here it is happening. And this is what they will be gaining the insights of from the cloud native Tech.
00:15:20 [W] Thanks last year. I had some amazing experience with visited multiple Nordic serious specifically all rows where Casper is based and couldn't work.
00:15:35 [W] We're just pleased based.
00:15:40 [W] I had a really amazing experience of speaking at the local media and government broke and I was really impressed breadth of topics that have been covered there. So Jessica one do want to provide for us an answer.
00:15:48 [W] How do you how do you select a good?
00:15:51 [W] Actually I meet ups where do you find a speakers and so on?
00:15:54 [W] I wish I could say that I had like a large pool of talks that I guess pick from whichever think has the best content and stuff. But honestly, I feel like that's one of the hardest problem to solve when organizing a Meetup is to find someone willing to provide content and
00:16:10 [W] Not that there's not enough people with content to share.
00:16:15 [W] It seems that a lot of people haven't done public speaking before they are very scared.
00:16:20 [W] All right, they think that they also think that what they have is not worth sharing.
00:16:23 [W] They think that their experience is not that special they think that their setup is too small to new there's like multiple different reasons why people don't want to share what they had been doing and I think that what I do a lot is that I
00:16:35 [W] What a lot of people when I meet them at meetups and I ask what they work about in the tell me something cool and I'm like, oh that sounds very interesting.
00:16:43 [W] Tell me more and after a while you try to like convince them that this would be a good talk.
00:16:56 [W] They don't have to prepare that much and what is important is used to share their experience because that's what I always find the most valuable to hear specific use cases and people sharing their own specific experience on working on something.
00:17:05 [W] Great.
00:17:10 [W] How about you prosper? You also have the beacon amazing a community that yeah, I totally agree.
00:17:14 [W] It's so in the beginning. It was kind of hard.
00:17:15 [W] We sort of did a lot of
00:17:19 [W] Trying out a lot of different kinds of ways to to, you know, run meetups.
00:17:51 [W] We've been doing for 4,500 talks.
00:17:53 [W] Being sort of an introduction level as well with ten minutes. You don't just choose a cncf product present that you don't expect you to be an expert or have any slides like that just present that and go through the readme and
00:18:07 [W] Talk about your takeaways from from that and that's been really successful.
00:18:11 [W] So we had some audio issues so you can if you can briefly repeat the beginning of your answer customer can be created from the first two sentences.
00:18:24 [W] here. We know we can hear it now and we could hear the two biggest part of your answer, but there were some. Okay.
00:18:38 [W] yeah, so so in the beginning we were doing as Jessica just told us about that. We were talking to people and encouraging them to step up and
00:18:44 [W] And be a speaker and help them as much as possible and have reviewed their slides before and just do whatever we sort of could to make them comfortable and presenting their their experiences because that's very important when you have new
00:18:58 [W] Step into this to be a speaker and luckily many of them found out that this was actually kind of cool and he did some chores with some of them around the nanak's as well as so that's been really really cool.
00:19:11 [W] Awesome.
00:19:25 [W] So this is my question is to our sun. But with ways to specifics of your Excel Essence in Seattle on their own and the Local Natives, but he also running the global syseleven Sargon you contributor ocean. So so how about your preparation
00:19:29 [W] Finding the content for their web server.
00:19:31 [W] Okay, so finding content. Well, my my experience with that currently is we kind of look at what
00:19:50 [W] sessions that we've had presented before at the new contributor workshop and finding new topics and ideas for people to present is for from me is about
00:20:05 [W] Finding things that we haven't really covered before so.
00:20:11 [W] Yeah, I'm just trying to think of a an example right now and there is a really good one, but I just can't remember it off the top of my head.
00:20:25 [W] Sorry another from yeah, it's just yeah fight finding topics that have been covered before and seeing if anyone's interested in covering those topics.
00:20:37 [W] Awesome. My next question is mostly to the folks that it has very some different organizations and communities Prosper. For example, you have not only here
00:20:53 [W] Running the local on Denmark knative successfully month was so how do we divide their delight and how to balance your responsibilities between the organizers in your group and in your local community?
00:21:06 [W] That's a really good question.
00:21:10 [W] And that's also one of the things that's been kind of hard.
00:21:11 [W] So we you know, who's we are right now for people organizing the Meetup and and all of us are doing this in our spare time and it's it can be challenging to have everybody sort of step in and do
00:21:25 [W] work so it's been been ongoing set of discussions on do you really think you have time for this and we've been what we've been been managing and we actually kept the nice Cadence I think and I think around one meet up a month is sort of
00:21:40 [W] in the past four years if you count out the last couple of months, but yeah, it can be challenging when you have many people involved and they have a lot of stuff going on kids
00:21:55 [W] And I have kids as well.
00:21:59 [W] It can be challenging to to do this but I get a lot of value out of it.
00:22:03 [W] I think it's really fun to do just go and talk to people and and yeah find new cool ways of seeing this this yeah, that's a paradigm basically.
00:22:15 [W] Yeah.
00:22:16 [W] Also, just how about you?
00:22:23 [W] I think it's very similar.
00:22:29 [W] It's always hard because people lives moving different Paces. So sometimes it's very hard for people to spend the time on preparing.
00:22:35 [W] They might be able to show up and help out you in the event but sometimes in periods there's a high load on certain individuals.
00:22:44 [W] And once again, it's like kind of hard to get that synchronization going and plan things with enough.
00:22:47 [W] Time I head to make it happen, but also not too much to make it to be too far off in the future so that you don't do this and time planning with until it's too late.
00:23:02 [W] But I think it requires every type of people because some part of the load is the getting the speaker's getting the contents and finding a location and and one part of it is to use make the event itself flow very well and
00:23:11 [W] With people in line before and after and stuff like that, so it requires every part of it to be covered and I think a great team we cover all of it together.
00:23:20 [W] Great Allison, are you doing the person for us to local meet up when you're in your area or you also have a team?
00:23:29 [W] In my area I'm currently not involved that much of any meetups is also moving soon. But there is a really good meat up that happens in New Zealand down and Wellington that I have been
00:23:49 [W] To before so that's a cloud native the cncf meet up that's in Wellington.
00:23:58 [W] Yeah.
00:24:01 [W] So yeah, that's that's my answer. Awesome Sam.
00:24:05 [W] How about with you?
00:24:09 [W] I know that draw so many people who are traveling. They meet up soon Bangalore.
00:24:10 [W] Oh, so do you also have a team or you're confronted them alone?
00:24:14 [W] Yeah, definitely alone.
00:24:18 [W] It's not possible.
00:24:19 [W] So I think meetups on the whole first of all, it's not a conference.
00:24:26 [W] So it's Community Driven event and in a Community Driven driven event. You need the help of the community as well.
00:24:34 [W] So here how we do is we have a certain set of people who come up with the ideas. So we brainstorm them maybe over slag channels or a small or Whatsapp or or call you one. So after brainstorming we decide
00:24:44 [W] Okay, this is the idea. Then they are we divide the work like one of the folks will be, you know, getting the venue and talking to the venue folks over there how it is going to be the seating capacity the presentation project, irr and all that stuff
00:25:00 [W] On the other hand other folks will be doing the marketing and you know, that's how they are getting divided over there.
00:25:11 [W] And we also create a small WhatsApp group for all the meetups that we do where we put in all the speakers and the organization so that any questions they are, you know a readily answered and there are no gaps.
00:25:20 [W] So that's how I'm doing currently.
00:25:22 [W] Awesome.
00:25:25 [W] We also have a good number of questions from the audience.
00:25:29 [W] So probably can focus a bit of them. And after that we can also compare to the original topic.
00:25:43 [W] So this is the question that Allison can answer the best. So jonathas asks if there are any any talks besides any talks on the natives, are there any other
00:25:50 [W] What's usually host like hackathons of open spaces and so on.
00:25:56 [W] I know that you are well experienced. There was some ways you can turn bitter Workshop in the symbol Knox.
00:26:04 [W] probably have some related experience into similarities.
00:26:05 [W] Yeah, so with there's definitely a lot of different formats, you know, the format that I'm particularly working on is working with
00:26:22 [W] Group of people in the community to deliver an asynchronous set of videos Workshop style content for a people in The Wider Community to enjoy.
00:26:36 [W] So other than that, I believe there's some of the other people on the panel to have had experience with doing rather than just a
00:26:49 [W] Is someone's on stage and talking workshops in particular?
00:26:55 [W] Yeah. Yeah.
00:27:00 [W] I answer that as so sure.
00:27:02 [W] Yeah, so we've been doing different kind of tracks also hack-a-thon sand and workshops.
00:27:09 [W] We call them hack nights and all those one time we ordered like to 1250 and Friends plushies and just invited all newcomers to kubenetes come and learn be this is a 101.
00:27:20 [W] We we want we actually figured out at some point that a couple of years in that you probably going too deep.
00:27:26 [W] And we needed to take a step back and sort of invite the newcomers to this as well.
00:27:37 [W] And that's why we created this hack night was to get newcomers in there and learn communities and get them up to speed on this new paradigm and having Plushies with Phoebe and all of that was really popular thing as well. And yeah, well, it's been really cool.
00:27:46 [W] Did it for free she has as well so I can definitely recommend doing that.
00:27:51 [W] awesome.
00:27:52 [W] Jessica - I also yeah, we have it. We've been trying to open space its format a few times or also similar like unconference tide and I would say that what we discovered was that most of the time people feel
00:28:09 [W] like that is a little bit too undefined before going there today our little bit uncertain knob will this be interesting to me but a format that works way better is to have first one specific technical talk and then open up for an open spacious because most of the people want
00:28:24 [W] To discuss different things they have different takes from it and they feel like there's something they want to talk more about with people and share experiences.
00:28:33 [W] So some kind of combination of presentation and Then followed by an open space has been really good and valuable for the attendees in our experience.
00:28:42 [W] So, how about you?
00:28:46 [W] Yeah, so yes hack-a-thon Zar very popular and hack nights.
00:28:53 [W] Yes, we do them as well.
00:29:00 [W] So hack nights bring people together and you know brainstorming the ideas and and I have seen a lot of support from different organizations who gave the cloud credits to the folks who are joining.
00:29:08 [W] Do you know build something build something AI solution or something like that?
00:29:09 [W] That's pretty interesting and on top of that whenever we are doing meet up we give like last half an hour to 40.
00:29:17 [W] To anyone to come and speak up about any product that they are using and how it is benefiting the community.
00:29:32 [W] So this this makes them feel like they are not only here to you know, just listen to the regular talks that if they're the agenda but also they will be able to participate actively
00:29:36 [W] First can I just add one more comment as well?
00:29:45 [W] This is just a shout out to Lucas.
00:29:46 [W] He actually did this small tool called Workshop CTO. It's not finished or anything like that.
00:29:54 [W] Our GitHub for Cloud - needed - knowledge Workshop CTL.
00:29:59 [W] It's a tool that can actually help in spinning up a workshop for very one on dka or whatever sort of Provider.
00:30:11 [W] I think UK right now so and digital ocean is supported but if you're interested in a tool like that, I can create a workshop cluster for you or your local Meetup show each attendee take a look at that and please help help us
00:30:20 [W] I felt that because I would be awesome if we could get some cool thing working there.
00:30:24 [W] Great another good question from Dominic.
00:30:31 [W] So Dominic asks us about mr.
00:30:39 [W] He briefly describes his personal story that he's interested to meet up some chatter.
00:30:42 [W] Oh, but nobody in his error even even driving even creating them.
00:30:54 [W] So Dominic asks, if it obviously they don't know all these things about about keeping areas. How do you think about
00:30:55 [W] This young cells and how do you handle expectations of the knative attendees? Well prepared. They made say I'm going to go first.
00:31:08 [W] Yeah, I can I can go for that so I can answer based on my personal experience over here.
00:31:19 [W] So when I started in flux meet up, so they were very limited number of people first of all who knew about the product and obviously when you don't know about anything, why would you want to learn it?
00:31:24 [W] So the thing is you will end up maybe in having maybe ten folks or five folks in your first Meetup, but that's completely fine in the beginning.
00:31:36 [W] You should not expect that.
00:31:40 [W] Okay / hundred folks will join me and because I'm doing it for the first time and it's it doesn't go like that.
00:31:46 [W] Have to do is just plan the Meetup even if you don't have knowledge, what you can do is you can have a 15 to 20 minutes live virtual session in your Meetup which can run on live on a zoom or whatever stuff that works.
00:31:58 [W] well for you and after that to whatever knowledge that you have you can share with the community and you all can you know sit together on a round table because first one definitely it's not going to be a hundred plus it will be very limited.
00:32:13 [W] So for the first one you need to be very focused like yes, the
00:32:16 [W] we have to do it and it is effective of how many people will join slowly slowly things will grow and the community grows and you will find people from the community who would be wanting to help you in organizing the future meetups.
00:32:27 [W] Awesome.
00:32:38 [W] Ah Allison the same question is to you about how to handle expectations for data use a we are workshops and similar activities determine so Henley expectations
00:32:44 [W] For attendees and people wanting to engage with content that we're providing to them.
00:32:57 [W] It has to be very clear kind of from the onset of what you're planning to deliver you yet.
00:33:06 [W] The more clear you are the more someone can make the Judgment of should I go outside catch a bus go into town.
00:33:14 [W] Own to goes visit this Meetup.
00:33:22 [W] So yeah that that's my my answer and the I just reading more into the question more of the question here if
00:33:33 [W] If there if there are people if your area doesn't seem like there's a lot of people who would be interested in this and animate up really reach out to the
00:33:48 [W] Online community and was the coronavirus pandemic a lot of people are streaming events and talks online.
00:34:03 [W] So even if you go on Twitch, you'll find lots of Live Events to watch and be a part of and participating.
00:34:07 [W] So yeah, that's my answer.
00:34:09 [W] Also, you can just go do what you're covering experience.
00:34:15 [W] I think that we did an interesting experience in the Canadian nordics. Just when everyone was starting working from home and we could not do meetups was that we set up sessions that were very specifically named so we had cognate hypnotics Cafe, which was like basically.
00:34:31 [W] A very special hangout for you can discuss whatever you had on your mind today and we had the tech talks which was more of a specific Deep dive technical description.
00:34:45 [W] Maybe use case may be more of a presentation about the topic and we had also the stories which was very much about specific use case on around a single topic that we decide beforehand.
00:34:58 [W] I think by Framing those like that we created very clear expectations.
00:35:02 [W] On what to expect from the sessions and I think it's something I would like to bring back to the meeting person meetups when they come back as well.
00:35:11 [W] Do you have anything to add on that Casper?
00:35:14 [W] I'm totally totally agree.
00:35:19 [W] I think naming naming was a really smart thing to do and I really love because the Casual Cafe hang out.
00:35:22 [W] We didn't have any topic or anything like that.
00:35:24 [W] It was just you know, 15 minutes to 30 minutes, whatever time sort of whatever the conversation was. Sometimes it.
00:35:31 [W] Shop, sometimes it was actually quite long.
00:35:34 [W] So it was really cool experience.
00:35:39 [W] But one thing we found out was that doing this every day was probably not a good idea.
00:35:43 [W] So we actually canceled it and we are still looking at different options and figuring out how we can Bridge shot of this virtual Universe with the physical Universe. Once we sort of can get back into the the physical meetups.
00:35:54 [W] And that's kind of hot.
00:35:59 [W] Nice.
00:36:01 [W] another question. Another question from Dominic. So Dominic is asking is asking here if you had any fears when you started building your local native communities for your
00:36:16 [W] Your communities have told us in elephants case Allison. Have you had any fears when you started doing that you contribute to real ships?
00:36:24 [W] So there has been through this whole experience.
00:36:39 [W] It's been a bit of a roller coaster because we were originally planning for hampsterdam in person this whole event and so
00:36:47 [W] That there has been just the consistent fear of just the pandemic coming in and just making a mess of plants. So that that's been a I think that's just a 2020 fear
00:37:03 [W] There is a is 2021 fear of all fears is would have to be you know, people not like
00:37:18 [W] Well, it's easy to get caught up in think oh what if people don't commit to this or not deliver or all that but in the at the end of the day, it's a it's a sort of it's a trust thing.
00:37:33 [W] And you know and people are human and make mistakes.
00:37:46 [W] So not really like a clear answer on that because I know that's just me being overly trusting and thing like everyone's gonna work together and it's gonna work out great, but yes my answer.
00:37:54 [W] Awesome, Sam.
00:37:58 [W] Have you had any fears building Day event or community and Community?
00:38:05 [W] Probably one of the biggest technical helps in the world so it could be challenging for you.
00:38:11 [W] Yeah, I mean there are a lot of fears and but fears leads to success, I believe so the biggest fear always is like I decide to do a meet-up at a particular location and they call me up and say okay.
00:38:22 [W] English book for any other visit so we got you some meat up.
00:38:27 [W] So everything is planned people have registered and they're ready to come and suddenly the it cancels.
00:38:37 [W] So it happens and it has happened to us and it might also happen in future. So you have to a minute.
00:38:38 [W] It's not a conference.
00:38:42 [W] So it's just a made-up that we are doing for the community.
00:38:44 [W] So even if it cancels it's fine now, sometimes it happens like there are five speakers and two of them will on the spot right at the moment will say they have some
00:38:52 [W] personal emergency and they won't be able to make it it's fine. I mean, yes, it's feel like be a few of the folks might have come to do it and just their talks so they might not be happy.
00:39:03 [W] But that's how it is.
00:39:05 [W] I mean you have to deal with this you have to just accept Okay, it's not that it cannot happen so it can happen to anyone.
00:39:15 [W] So all those PS are there but when you take it casually I think it becomes more successful. That's that's my take on that.
00:39:18 [W] Perfect. We're almost out of time but still have time for Jessica some cusper answers. So if you can and you can show us briefly your theorists experience, I think for me the biggest fear is
00:39:34 [W] Every single time that no one will show that I will have like Fifty to a hundred people registered and no one would show up.
00:39:48 [W] It almost happened once and it was a live round like 50 people registered and only like 10 people showing up and actually was one of the best discussions I had with the Meetup. So we're still like a success for the people that showed
00:39:55 [W] So that was definitely good anyway.
00:39:58 [W] Yes, and I'm going to cost prohibitive.
00:40:02 [W] Yeah same for me.
00:40:05 [W] Awesome.
