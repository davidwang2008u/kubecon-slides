00:05:41 [W] Hello everyone. Welcome to Q Khan virtual. And today we are going to talk on 34 truths about Cuban Aries and H.
00:05:50 [W] My name is Ian part of and I'm a software engineer working at Walmart Labs. My Twitter Handler is Sam Potter.
00:06:03 [W] I'm CK ack decertified.
00:06:03 [W] I'm a cncf Ambassador and over Community leader.
00:06:11 [W] I run a lot of meetup groups including Rancher and flux talker and Bangalore.
00:06:17 [W] I mean in flux ace and I also run a YouTube channel where I do a lot of live streams with other community members today. I am joined with Karthik.
00:06:21 [W] Thanks. I am my name is Karthik a quad and I'm the head of cloudevents engineering at verico. I'm the author of learning kubenetes and a bunch of other cognitive courses on LinkedIn learning part of Erica.
00:06:38 [W] I built the Oracle managed to Banaras engine and was a principal developer at Oracle Cloud.
00:06:47 [W] I also don't do a bunch of community stuff. Like devops is Austin Cloud Austin all day devops and containerd days. I've been in industry for a while and you can find me more on iteration one on Twitter.
00:06:53 [W] On LinkedIn learning part of Erica, I built the Oracle managed kubenetes engine and was a principal developer at Oracle Cloud.
00:07:12 [W] I also don't do a bunch of community stuff. Like devops is Austin Cloud Austin all day devops and containerd days.
00:07:12 [W] I've been in industry for a while and you can find me more on iteration one on Twitter.
00:07:13 [W] Today we'll go into more about Edge Computing and talk about the intersection of Edge and Cuba. Nettie's will discuss some of the complexities that we see from an edge perspective and how kubenetes and k3s helps us from that perspective.
00:07:16 [W] We'll talk more about Cloud native it Edge do a really sweet demo about how to run k3s on a Raspberry Pi cluster talk more about complexities that edge and then give you some recommendations.
00:07:22 [W] So, what is Edge Computing if you look at Wikipedia, it describes as Computing as a distributed computing Paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it's needed to improve response time and save bandwidth. And also
00:07:38 [W] How to run k3s on a Raspberry Pi cluster talk more about complexities that edge and then give you some recommendations.
00:07:39 [W] So, what is Edge Computing if you look at Wikipedia, it describes as Computing as a distributed computing Paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it's needed to improve response time and save bandwidth. And also
00:07:40 [W] Edge Computing there's a lot of growth from the Gartner and Forrester reviews Gartner said that by 2023 that could be more than 20 times as many smart devices on the edge of the network as in conventional.
00:07:51 [W] It rolls Forrester actually said that the edge Cloud Market will grow at least by 50%
00:07:59 [W] But what does this all really mean?
00:08:02 [W] Big an engineer.
00:08:07 [W] I like to break this problem down by looking at specific use cases in my time at National instruments and Mentor embedded.
00:08:17 [W] I spent a lot of time looking at the intersection between the cloud and Edge devices or embedded devices in general.
00:08:24 [W] One of the my favorite things that used to come up a lot of times was how do we get all the stuff to work in the case of wind turbines? So we'll take that as a use case.
00:08:27 [W] For my turbine perspective from an individual wind turbine you want to do a bunch of calculations.
00:08:37 [W] So in this case turbine might want to calculate the window blade speed the efficiency of each blade how much power is consuming and what the term operating temperature might be.
00:08:44 [W] Formal control perspective you might want to understand what the generator speed is.
00:08:51 [W] Try and increase it or decrease it.
00:08:53 [W] Look at the big blade adjustment angle.
00:08:59 [W] So the blade attachment angle the turbines can actually move them both in a horizontal or a vertical way and there are times when you actually want to change that angle to be able to generate more electricity and also the wind turbine rotation so you can actually rotate the turbine left to right
00:09:09 [W] Blade how much power it's consuming and what the term operating temperature might be.
00:09:09 [W] Flowmill control perspective you might want to understand what the generator speed is.
00:09:10 [W] Try and increase it or decrease it.
00:09:10 [W] Look at the big blade adjustment angle.
00:09:11 [W] So the blade attachment angle the turbines can actually move in a bowl in a horizontal or a vertical way and there are times when you actually want to change that angle to be able to generate more electricity and also the wind turbine rotation so you can actually rotate the turbine left to right
00:09:14 [W] There are times when you might want to do that too because the wind direction might be from a different kind of perspective.
00:09:18 [W] So those are the different controls that you might have from a turbine standpoint.
00:09:19 [W] Probable Wind Farm control center.
00:09:24 [W] So the control center is more of a place where you might have a lot of folks kind of looking at your whole turbine farm from a holistic perspective.
00:09:35 [W] So I threw in a picture of your iberdrola Renewables controlled control room and from from that perspective, you're kind of looking at the whole Farm.
00:09:43 [W] So, you know, you might be collecting your average turbine speeds in there looking at the health status of each of your individual turbines monitoring performance of the turbines node if there's
00:09:50 [W] If there are things that might not be working with an individual turbine, you might need to send a technician out and go get that fixed Etc.
00:09:59 [W] Also monitor the general efficiency of the farm.
00:10:01 [W] is it actually generating a lot of electricity or you know, is there something wrong from like a farm perspective and then also one of the big goals is to be able to generate electricity so, you know be able to calculate that from a whole Farm perspective.
00:10:15 [W] So if you kind of look at this from like an architecture from a really really high level architecture standpoint
00:10:23 [W] From the cloud level you have the cloud is responsible.
00:10:29 [W] You can think of this more of you know from the high level from the control center perspective.
00:10:39 [W] Signs monitoring performance of the turbines know if there's if there are things that might not be working with an individual turbine.
00:10:45 [W] You might need to send a technician out and go get that fixed Etc.
00:10:45 [W] Also monitor the general efficiency of the farm.
00:10:45 [W] is it actually generating a lot of electricity or you know, is this something wrong from like a farm perspective? And then also one of the big goals is to be able to generate electricity so, you know be able to calculate that from a whole Farm perspective.
00:10:47 [W] So if you kind of look at this from like
00:10:51 [W] An architecture from a really really high level architecture standpoint from the cloud level you have the cloud is responsible.
00:10:54 [W] You can think of this more of you know from the high level from the control center perspective.
00:10:55 [W] So it is responsible for the overall operations of the farm, you know, big data processing. So you have a bunch of data coming in to your to a wind farm you might want to throw that into the cloud to do additional processing aggregate different data Etc across,
00:11:00 [W] you know a lot of times that you might want to use the cloud if you have multiple Farms you want to do more data aggregation of equality of Arms from an individual Farm level or from your control center at a specific farm that is more responsible
00:11:01 [W] As in there it's connected to the internet.
00:11:08 [W] So if you have two sets and data up to the cloud you're able to do that and also connected to the all the turbines in the farm as well typical use case that I've seen over here is the turbines are connected via Ethernet or you know,
00:11:19 [W] Some other kind of way, but ethernet is pretty popular these days and then going down to the sensor level or to the turbine level the turbine itself, you know, you can think of it more like an individual iot sensor or an iot device.
00:11:34 [W] So in this case for the turbine, it's responsible for electricity generation, you know in a safe Manner and also efficient operations and data collection add an individual turbine level.
00:11:46 [W] So what are some typical Edge issues that we've seen?
00:11:51 [W] From an edge perspective and from a device perspective typical issues are you know battery?
00:11:59 [W] There's a lack of processing power.
00:12:02 [W] So if you want to run, you know heavyweight calculations Etc.
00:12:04 [W] You just not able to do that the code deployments need to be tiny because there's not a lot of RAM and memory on the actual board and then you also have you know, embedded device concerned. So like you can actually put something too big on there or you know other concerns that
00:12:17 [W] From you know from a cloud perspective at the edge level.
00:12:23 [W] It's all about connectivity.
00:12:25 [W] So, you know, everything connected up.
00:12:29 [W] Is it easy to connect multiple devices to the edge?
00:12:32 [W] Is it easy to connect your control center back to internet to me. I put communicate with cloud of your so your communication line to to the internet needs to be pretty good and then have enough processing power
00:12:44 [W] Calculations typically, this is not a problem.
00:12:53 [W] But this used to be a problem back in the day. When you had to build out like your own kind of data center inside of you know, inside of your control plane or your control tower and then as maintenance of your senses and farm, this doesn't happen
00:13:03 [W] And or your control tower and then as maintenance of your senses and farm, this doesn't happen super often, but it does like your senses might go offline to might be issues with individual turbines Etc.
00:13:11 [W] And then you need to go and address maintenance issues off your sensors. So that's that's something that happens quite a lot on the edge level.
00:13:17 [W] So where does kubenetes fit in all of here?
00:13:22 [W] One of the things about this whole ecosystem is that there's actually a lot of vendors but they're very like vendor-specific and then you have walk into your you know to your iot devices or to Edge devices.
00:13:37 [W] So there's a ton of custom solution providers.
00:13:45 [W] So, you know, you might approach a specific provider about hey, I need like a solution for my Wind Farm like what do you have to provide and you can go talk to individual vendors that will help you kind of, you know, build and maintain all of these solutions for your whole Wind Farm the one
00:13:52 [W] Really nice thing about Cuba Nettie's and one of the reasons it's caught on really well in the cloud computing Market is that it's based on an open source ecosystem. So you can have open source kind of in the cloud. You can also have open source on the edge side of things and
00:14:07 [W] Like kubenetes is that it's built for managing many devices.
00:14:15 [W] So things like scaling and deployment Etc. All of those things are, you know are ingrained in the in the kubenetes mindset and in the Cuban Embassy ecosystem.
00:14:26 [W] So if you look at kubenetes distribution specifically built for Edge, there's two two really popular kinds for this right now. There's kubenetes k3s this presentation.
00:14:35 [W] We'll talk more about k3s. And with that I will hand it back over to sign.
00:14:38 [W] Um, so that was a great introduction by Karthik on kubenetes and Edge why kubenetes 4H and what exactly is it?
00:14:47 [W] Let us now understand what actually the problem is that we as Engineers are trying to solve so we have Edge and we want to Leverage The highly complex ecosystem of kubenetes. @h now in order to do that, we have k3s,
00:15:00 [W] Linkerd discussed today. So k3s is another open source cncf 35 kubenetes distribution.
00:15:07 [W] Which has all the powers of kubernative and it is extremely suitable for Edge.
00:15:20 [W] So as you can see, it's extremely lightweight and by lightweight when I say it means it is less than a 50 mb binary. So which is huge.
00:15:28 [W] so it removes all the entry Cloud providers. It removes all the entries storage drive errs, and it removes all the alpha features. So it's basically a very trim down code base version of the knative kubenetes distribution.
00:15:37 [W] It's specifically built for arm.
00:15:42 [W] So when the developers were building kubenetes, so there were two things first. Like we have to make something for the edge for the arm devices second.
00:15:50 [W] It should not only be for the developer environment.
00:15:52 [W] It should be Focus for production.
00:15:55 [W] Yes, you can definitely use it for developer developer scenarios, but it is readily built for production and it is good for all the production-ready scenarios.
00:16:05 [W] It has full power of kubenetes. So when we say that the code base is strimzi.
00:16:07 [W] And so the power of kubenetes reduces.
00:16:10 [W] No, it's not the case.
00:16:12 [W] So the code base is reduced.
00:16:14 [W] But still you get the full power of kubenetes and most importantly everything is running every single process.
00:16:21 [W] So which is what makes it so simple efficient and fast.
00:16:23 [W] Request for production.
00:16:30 [W] Yes, you can definitely use it for developer developer scenarios, but it is readily built for production and it is good for all the production-ready scenarios.
00:16:31 [W] It has full power of kubenetes.
00:16:31 [W] So when we say that the code base is trimmed. So the power of kubenetes reduces.
00:16:31 [W] No, it's not the case.
00:16:32 [W] So the code base is reduced. But still you get the full power of kubenetes.
00:16:32 [W] And most importantly everything is running every single process so which is what makes it so simple efficient and fast.
00:16:34 [W] Let's quickly dive into the architecture of k3s. So on the left hand side, you have the k3s server and on the right you have the k3s agent.
00:16:37 [W] Now everything is running as a single process.
00:16:43 [W] So it's typically the same architecture as you have of a given radius 1 but here what additional thing is the tunnel proxy.
00:16:49 [W] So the agent registers itself to the server via Eternal proxy. And once the connection is established after the communication happens where this particular tunnel between the agent and the server rest.
00:16:57 [W] rest. It has the Escalade database which is inside the process itself and it CD is not used.
00:17:05 [W] In the back and they're using kind and it's a pluggable kind of architecture. So if you want to Har Ki texture for k3s you go for you can go for MySQL you can go for postgres.
00:17:14 [W] And also it has containerd e in built so you don't have Docker you don't have to install anything.
00:17:24 [W] So it has the Conn containerd e in built, it has traffic as Ingress controller as well which helps you gave the load balancing capabilities.
00:17:32 [W] So that's the high level Architecture Firm k3s.
00:17:33 [W] So today what we are going to demo is we will be measuring the CPU temperature of Raspberry Pi's, which are running a k3s key when it is custom.
00:17:50 [W] So we are having to Raspberry Pi's and we'll be installing k3s on top of that.
00:17:56 [W] So we are having to Raspberry Pi's and we'll be installing k3s on top of that.
00:18:00 [W] We will be deploying a demon set a deployment as a service for in flux a deployment in service for Griffon.
00:18:07 [W] Ah in the demon said what we'll be using is we'll be scraping the temperature of Raspberry Pi sending it to in flux, then we'd realizing the graphs from the fauna.
00:18:12 [W] So let's go it's demo time.
00:18:16 [W] So in this particular Demo First, we will install k3s on Raspberry Pi's.
00:18:28 [W] So I already have two Raspberry Pi's connected. So let's log into both the devices.
00:18:31 [W] Let's log in here.
00:18:34 [W] I went to my super secret password.
00:18:40 [W] Let's log into the another instance.
00:18:41 [W] Yes, I'm logged into both instances.
00:18:47 [W] So now the Raspberry Pi will be working as the k3s server and the Raspberry Pi agent will be the agent will connect to the server now k3s installation as I have mentioned before as well.
00:19:06 [W] It's pretty simple.
00:19:10 [W] So it's as simple as one command.
00:19:11 [W] That's it.
00:19:13 [W] So it's finding the stable release its using V1 Dot 18.6 and it's downloading the binaries and within a couple of seconds.
00:19:19 [W] K3s server will be up and running.
00:19:22 [W] K3s has been successfully installed now in order to check that we will just do k3s cute CDL get nodes.
00:19:39 [W] Yay, our Master node is up, but it's not ready.
00:19:50 [W] Let's do it. Once again. So k3s Cube cereal get nodes are Master node is ready up and running with kubenetes version B 1.1 8.6 now, let's grab the token.
00:20:02 [W] So now we are going to install the k3s agent on the Raspberry Pi agent.
00:20:06 [W] What's that?
00:20:10 [W] We have to give the k3s URL which is the server URL which is HTTP and two dot one sixty eight dot Wonder 129 6443 then we give the k3s token.
00:20:27 [W] It finds the stable release and download the version.
00:20:49 [W] And then install the k3s agent.
00:20:53 [W] They have to give the k3s URL which is the server URL which is HTTP and two dot one sixty eight dot one dot 129 6443 then we give the k3s token.
00:21:02 [W] It finds the stable release and download the version.
00:21:05 [W] And then install the k3s agent.
00:21:05 [W] So Siam white while this is running I have a question for you would be a century run this command if we were running this on multiple agents.
00:21:06 [W] Yes, gotcha. Looks really easy then.
00:21:07 [W] So basically if you have multiple agents, you just have to run this command and it's done.
00:21:14 [W] So that's it. The k3s agent has also started.
00:21:26 [W] now, you can check the service or you can directly go to the server one and do a k3s cube CDL get nodes.
00:21:34 [W] And what we see over here is magically in a matter of minutes. We have our k3s server and the k3s agent up and running now, we do not need this window.
00:21:48 [W] So let's move over to the code which we are going to deploy today.
00:21:56 [W] So this is the GitHub repository, which is available.
00:21:58 [W] So as shown in the demo diagram, so what we are going to do is we are going to have running a demon set.
00:22:06 [W] So we are going to deploy these three files, which is a demon set a griffon uyama land in flux geometry. So in the demon set
00:22:17 [W] we just have image and I will walk you through the code.
00:22:21 [W] For demon said is something which runs on all the nodes.
00:22:25 [W] So the Griffon Anna is having a deployment.
00:22:29 [W] Three years server and the k3s agent up and running now. We do not need this window.
00:22:30 [W] So let's move over to the code which we are going to deploy today.
00:22:31 [W] So this is the GitHub repository, which is available.
00:22:31 [W] So as shown in the demo diagram, so what we are going to do is we are going to have running a demon set.
00:22:32 [W] So we are going to deploy these three files, which is a demon set a griffon uyama land in flux geometry. So in the demon set
00:22:32 [W] We just have image and I will walk you through the code.
00:22:34 [W] For demon set is something which runs on all the nodes.
00:22:34 [W] So the Griffon a' is having a deployment.
00:22:35 [W] and a service
00:22:35 [W] and it is using the fauna Docker image with the container Port 3000.
00:22:42 [W] Similarly for in flux.
00:22:47 [W] We have a deployment for influx in flux 1.7 and we have both 8086 and we have exposed the service has no port.
00:22:54 [W] Now what exactly the code is doing?
00:23:02 [W] So we are taking the influx DB client.
00:23:08 [W] We are establishing the client.
00:23:12 [W] We are creating the database.
00:23:14 [W] We are switching to that database. We are having a time stamp.
00:23:17 [W] Now this particular file gives you the temperature the CPU temperature updated.
00:23:23 [W] all times
00:23:25 [W] And we create adjacent body where we send all the tags in the fields.
00:23:31 [W] Then we write the disembody to in flux and this code is running every 5 Seconds.
00:23:37 [W] So this is what the code is.
00:23:41 [W] So now let's clone the repository and deploy all the files.
00:23:43 [W] So let's do a git clone and the Clone is already done.
00:23:54 [W] So we Siri into
00:23:55 [W] died from the fields
00:24:00 [W] then we write the Jason body to in flux and this code is running every 5 Seconds.
00:24:00 [W] So this is what the code is.
00:24:01 [W] So now let's clone the repository and deploy all the files.
00:24:01 [W] So let's do a git clone.
00:24:01 [W] And the Clone is already done.
00:24:01 [W] So we see re into folder video LS and we do a k3s cube serial apply.
00:24:02 [W] often deploy
00:24:05 [W] It's all the animal files should be deployed.
00:24:20 [W] So it is create. It has created. The demon said it has created the deployment and the service or group wanna it has created the deployment and the service for in flux.
00:24:20 [W] And now if we see k3s Cube CDL get pods.
00:24:28 [W] We can see all the pods are in running state.
00:24:33 [W] So let's quickly see the services.
00:24:36 [W] So I'll grow fauna is running on three 1712. So let's go back and open Griffon rui.
00:24:48 [W] So we are we have our graph on elotl.
00:24:57 [W] So we quickly put the username password we skip it.
00:25:05 [W] So we have our graph on our let's quickly add the data source.
00:25:10 [W] So since we have in flux, so we'll choose in flux, which is a knative data source and grow fauna.
00:25:19 [W] We will put the URL.
00:25:20 [W] we'll put the
00:25:30 [W] URL
00:25:30 [W] and we have created Cube Khan as a database.
00:25:32 [W] We save and test and taters also is working now.
00:25:40 [W] Let's go ahead and create a dashboard a new panel.
00:25:46 [W] We select the measurement which is temp we select the value which is the temperature.
00:25:49 [W] And we added a tag which is the system and let's do some filtering with the balls.
00:25:57 [W] and let's expand this particular area more so that we have some data and you can see we have the temperature coming from Raspberry Pi which is a Servo and the Raspberry Pi agent, which is the agent and for both we are having
00:26:14 [W] 74 degrees and we have 78 79 degrees over here.
00:26:25 [W] Tricks we everything is getting captured and on top of it. We can create some alerts.
00:27:45 [W] So if the temperature goes above maybe 80% so you get an alert and you can have different notifications.
00:27:46 [W] So this is just one use case where what we have seen is we have our temperature sensing from a Raspberry Pi now this particular use case can be extended to any number of sensors like Karthik has talked for windmill where temperature is an essential part.
00:27:49 [W] Art and can be extended to other sensors and have all things in place.
00:27:51 [W] So you have one stable thing ready?
00:27:55 [W] And now you can add top of on top of it. You can add different sensing and get all the data and do machine learning on top of it starts to get analysis on top of it and get valuable insights and forecasting.
00:27:55 [W] So that's it for today's demo. Hope you like it back to you Karthik.
00:27:56 [W] Cool.
00:28:02 [W] Thanks.
00:28:02 [W] I am that was awesome.
00:28:03 [W] Not a lot of time to do demos actually work the first time and so, you know, this is pretty cool.
00:28:03 [W] Okay. I'm going to share my screen again.
00:28:03 [W] All right.
00:28:04 [W] So in our demo Sam talk through how things actually worked on the k3s cluster that we had created.
00:28:04 [W] Let's look at a couple of challenges that we've seen from an edge Computing standpoint and then will you know open up for questions at the end of this talk?
00:28:07 [W] So from a from a challenge as perspective and from a future perspective.
00:28:08 [W] know you have one of the biggest thing in this whole sector is the idea of vendor lock-in. So that's the value from
00:28:09 [W] Of using kubenetes at Edge Solutions, you know kind of like k3s or kubenetes as well.
00:28:19 [W] One thing that we still have some more work to do. I think from Cuba Nettie sedge perspective is more Hardware integration.
00:28:27 [W] So you saw that it was pretty seamless to work with Raspberry Pi but what about four specific iot devices that you might have, you know, you might be building and
00:28:31 [W] you know building and testing out your specific Edge devices or your iot devices that might be work or some missing things that you might have to do from k3s oq bridgecrew spective.
00:28:46 [W] The biggest thing all here also is a cultural challenges and you know, we've kind of seen this as well with just back end developers and front-end developers, but also the folks actually working on the iot side.
00:28:58 [W] those are embedded developers and their mindset is very different from kind of
00:29:01 [W] We think about from a cloud native perspective or from a cloud knative developer perspective.
00:29:09 [W] Actually working on the iot side.
00:29:15 [W] Those are embedded developers and their mindset is very different from kind of what we think about from a cloud native perspective or from a cloud knative developer perspective.
00:29:16 [W] So it's a different Tech stack see is very common from that text back over there.
00:29:18 [W] So and then also for us in the cloud knative World things like ci/cd continuous integration continuous deployment delivery. Those things are are very normal and you know, those are things that we think are.
00:29:25 [W] Car about a friend but from an embedded developer standpoint, they might not even know what CII or CD might be so there are challenges that you'll end up facing there when you kind of bring to despair. It's a developers to get also
00:29:40 [W] To despair. It's a developers to get also understanding your architectural needs.
00:29:43 [W] So, you know, we kind of talked about Raspberry Pi and how to run k3s and Raspberry Pi. We also talked about the wind farm example, so, you know from if you tick take like a 30,000 foot view on this kubenetes is really good for cloud for
00:29:56 [W] God 30,000 foot view on this kubenetes is really good for cloud for cloud at Ascent ER compute instances.
00:30:02 [W] So you're managing your whole data center with Cuba Nettie's.
00:30:03 [W] That's why it's really popular cubits from our reading is really good for you know, when you want to have a cloud control plane and you want to get spared Edge devices or instances.
00:30:17 [W] It's great for controlling that so think of the, you know, if you're using Nest kind of devices Etc where they're all able to connect to the cloud or to a cloud control.
00:30:21 [W] Lane kubeedge would work really well over there k3s is also really good for the cloud use cases and edges well as well for air gap environments.
00:30:36 [W] So in the scenario where you have a wind farm, and you know, you actual turbines don't have access to the internet, but they're still connected up to a local network.
00:30:39 [W] It would work pretty well in those environments as well where you have more kind of air gap kind of scenarios.
00:30:46 [W] Well, thank you God.
00:30:46 [W] Thank you. Now. Let's dive into the future discussion on the state of kubenetes NH.
00:30:51 [W] So let's make it a informal discussion and not a very formal PowerPoint kind of discussion.
00:31:02 [W] So I think that kubenetes will play a very important role for H.
00:31:20 [W] Gordon role in handling these operations
00:31:23 [W] Why because people and the companies are transitioning into the virtualization world and building apps for cloudevents go system and they want to change the apps change the versions all that stuff and kubernative will definitely play a very important.
00:31:29 [W] speaking about k3s as we have already spoken like k3s is extremely lightweight and it gives you the full power of kubenetes act Edge. So it becomes extremely important that we should know where k3s stands
00:31:39 [W] I too feel since the Rancher acquisition by Suicide. So we have seen that they have been questions around like how this k3s product will be going on, but it has been made very clear by the leadership from Rancher
00:31:54 [W] Yes, we'll be there go forward product and it will remain open source, and people will keep on contributing to k3s.
00:32:04 [W] Now. If you go by the stats, I see that it has more than 13,000 GitHub Stars, which is pretty amazing.
00:32:11 [W] It has a wide Community adoption and people actually love it.
00:32:17 [W] So that's why they have built products on top of k3s. So if you see open source enthusiasts like Alex he built k3s up which is pronounced as ketchup.
00:32:25 [W] For so it's basically bootstrapping the k3s cluster in less than a minute.
00:32:35 [W] So, so that's that's the adoption that we have. Then there are few companies like C. Vo who is who built up the first ever managed k3s service. So so people have already started looking k3s as a stable product
00:32:45 [W] Based in line with the Upstream kubenetes updates.
00:32:54 [W] So whenever the version of a new version comes so k3s team and the open source folks they work and make it, you know matching the Upstream kubenetes version.
00:33:00 [W] So I think yes k3s itself has a very bright future and people are making they have their own Maps very clear and the issues the pull requests a doll.
00:33:14 [W] Kathy is definitely has a bright future and with this definitely it will be used for
00:33:15 [W] or Edge because that was a primary use case for k3s.
00:33:22 [W] So H Computing will definitely be very powerful become very powerful with the usage of k3s.
00:33:28 [W] So with that what do you think our take like where there's a future stand from kubenetes NH perspective
00:33:33 [W] I totally agree with you.
00:33:42 [W] I was kind of trying to think about whether you know to kind of go deeper into the technology or think of it from a high level perspective anything from you know, from a high level perspective from a tech standpoint. I think we're there today
00:33:49 [W] K3s whether it's to badge I think the idea of using something like kubenetes that helps you that basically helps you take you know, a single device put basically an operating system on
00:34:05 [W] To take you know, a single device put basically an operating system on there and then scale that for, you know hundreds like nodes of many clusters.
00:34:14 [W] I think that it's pretty proven technology today from a k3s that board from kubeedge tent forever.
00:34:20 [W] So I think we have Solutions, which is great.
00:34:22 [W] mentioned before that the the challenge I think that we will face at least in this next year. Maybe next couple of years is to
00:34:29 [W] First and what the problems are understand what the real problems are from an embedded developer standpoint.
00:34:39 [W] So a lot of it, you know comes from like bridging communities, right?
00:34:47 [W] Because I think the community is that we have from Tech standpoint like you and I were squarely in like the cloud native space where like yeah kubenetes.
00:34:53 [W] We understand Italy might not know everything about it, but I think we know like from like a pretty good perspective of like how the however it works architectural structural implementation. Whatever.
00:35:00 [W] But I don't think anybody in the embedded space really knows about a lot of the stuff that you know, we're kind of coming out with whether it's k3s, whether it's kubeedge whether it's just even to Binet. He's or Prometheus or are like any of the things in our ecosystem.
00:35:15 [W] Everything about it, but I think we know like from like a pretty good perspective of like how that however, it works architectural structural implementation.
00:35:16 [W] whatever but I don't think anybody in the embedded space really knows about a lot of the stuff that you know, we're kind of coming out with whether it's k3s, whether it's kubeedge whether it's just even kubenetes or Prometheus or are like
00:35:18 [W] The the challenge will be you know, advocating a lot of these platforms to folks that actually writing a medic code and being like hey, I know you're trying to solve these mqtt problems and you're trying to write this this mqtt code specifically for
00:35:32 [W] But did you know there's like a tool that you can use to or not?
00:35:39 [W] not true, but a platform that you can use to kind of manage all of this stuff by default and you know, kind of get get some kind of reception from what you know, what what folks who are actually in that ecosystem have so understand, you know,
00:35:52 [W] Option from what?
00:35:52 [W] you know, what what folks who are actually in that ecosystem have so understand, you know kind of understanding the pain points and then bringing it back and then, you know building on the next generation of what k3s R Cube Edge is going to become
00:36:00 [W] and then, you know building on the the next generation of what k3s R cubed is going to become and I think we will probably end up finding things that we might have missed from a first pass whether it's a we need, you know,
00:36:10 [W] Is past whether it's a we need, you know, it's great that it works with rest apis.
00:36:21 [W] But really we need all the communication to work with, you know mqtt or you know, we need something even more low-powered like Bluetooth or something like that and we have to write you know more more apis that help communicate, you know.
00:36:27 [W] So it will tear the something something something similar to that. So, you know, it might sound kind of lofty but it's kind of figure out how we can bring embedded engineer's that are kind of in their own ecosystem might be in their own Silo, but
00:36:43 [W] You kind of fire Cloud native tribe and I think that's where like the next generation of problems for us will be it's not necessarily like technology, but it'll you know, it will end up being more of like Hey, we're we built we built this
00:36:59 [W] Folks that are you know that our Cloud native that understand how you know to deploy and run applications in the cloud. But now we're trying to extend that away extend that into the ecosystem of ma, you know embedded as well.
00:37:14 [W] So that's kind of where I think well at least for the next couple of years will go because I feel like we have something pretty good in our space and you know, let's let's take it forward and figure out what we can actually do with it.
00:37:27 [W] Yeah. I completely agree to all those points Karthik.
00:37:32 [W] And even even I feel like, you know, the use case is like people want to do machine learning it Edge like capturing billions of images and not sending them to Cloud do to latency issues and all that.
00:37:43 [W] So they need Solutions which can be fit into their specific small data centers and they can do, you know machine learning and top of that anomaly detection on top of that whether you take the example of future innovators and finding the defect from that
00:37:57 [W] Apple off the CCTV footage is and you know doing the capturing the per second images and doing mlperf top of that.
00:38:10 [W] So yes, the there is a huge need for the cloud native ecosystem over there and the engineers who are building these devices. They need to understand like these might be the challenges and this might be the right Hardware to create
00:38:22 [W] That that particular portion fits well with the cloud native TxTag that we have today.
00:38:28 [W] Sounds like it sounds like were it folks can you know come up with like good reference architectures for what everybody else is doing then we might actually be able to do some cool things in the space, too. Yeah, totally agree.
00:38:44 [W] Hmm.
00:38:49 [W] Awesome. Well Sam, do you have any think we're probably almost close to time the any last last-minute thoughts that you have before we close down.
00:39:00 [W] No, I think like we did a small demo today.
00:39:07 [W] So I would like to encourage all the attendees to go back and try something out and let us know like what you you feel about kubenetes and Edge and what you are trying to do with your home laps and or even add
00:39:14 [W] Idea organizations, and we will be happy to hear and happy to help to the best of our knowledge.
00:39:20 [W] Yep, totally agree. And once again, you can read Siam on on Twitter @ sign parsec and I'm iteration one on Twitter.
00:39:34 [W] I think we're probably at the end of our session. So, you know, we'll be around. If you have questions for us use, you know, use use this use the slack or we're actually both on the community side as well. So you can you know, you can
00:39:44 [W] And or even add idea organizations and we will be happy to hear and happy to help to the best of our knowledge.
00:39:46 [W] Yep, totally agree. And once again, you can reach them on on Twitter at sympathetic and I'm iteration 1 and Twitter.
00:39:47 [W] I think we're probably at the end of our session. So, you know, we'll be around. If you have questions for us use, you know, use use this use the slack or we're actually both on the community slack as well. So you can you know, you can finger
00:39:50 [W] But we'll hang out after after a session.
00:39:50 [W] So, you know, we're not hard to find so I hope this was useful for y'all and thank you for attending our talk.
00:39:56 [W] Yeah, okay.
00:39:58 [W] Awesome. It looks like we got a few questions.
00:40:14 [W] I will light up these Sam. Actually.
00:40:17 [W] We got a lot of questions about kubenetes and whether you can use a full kubenetes Master with k3s agents and mix and match between arm and x86 devices.
00:40:30 [W] You want to talk about that a little bit.
00:40:31 [W] Yeah, so, I believe we have a couple of questions around the mixed architecture that people want to try like if you're I don't think that it's really possible. Like you have a cake a it's because that's a separate kind of whole distribution
00:40:46 [W] And it doesn't run as a single process whereas k3s will be running as a single process.
00:40:59 [W] So you when you're making the connection, so I don't think that that really work out and so k3s itself will be a single given it is distribution that you're trying to use like any other kubenetes distribution and you won't be able to mix and match that
00:41:08 [W] Our scenario where you say that I have an x86 system will k3s itself is running and I'm trying to connect it to and ARM device.
00:41:23 [W] So I think that that with some networking tweets, that should be possible though.
00:41:24 [W] I'm not a hundred percent sure.
00:41:26 [W] I need to try that but that should be together.
00:41:27 [W] And the other thing to keep in mind is it's all open source. So I think if you start seeing use cases where you really need to connect k8s / k3s agent to a k8s cluster, I would probably start with an issue on the k3s creepo and kind of take it from there,
00:41:44 [W] Still really early with this there were also a bunch of questions on what like, how do you kind of use this in production?
00:41:53 [W] What are best practices and whether we've seen like reference architectures on it? And I think we're in that phase right now where we are still kind of a lot of people are using this from from, you know, inside their homes or inside like demo
00:42:08 [W] That haven't seen somebody, you know take the student into production themselves sighing. I don't know if you have yet.
00:42:16 [W] Yeah, so I talked with Rancher poke sometime back and they have told that lot of people are using k3s actually in production and they have a very solid documentation on how you can actually run
00:42:32 [W] You will be having my tea Masters and then you will be connecting all the nodes.
00:42:42 [W] So right now the demo that I showed is a single, you know a single master and it is getting connected and it's a sqlite but when you go through the production-ready architectures, if you go through the documentation, you will be having a my SQL kind of database or
00:42:52 [W] Based on the kind of architecture and got needs. So yes, they have the documentation how you can go and create your production-ready cluster using k3s.
00:43:05 [W] So I think that that should be your starting point.
00:43:06 [W] And yes, like Karthik said you can raise an issue on GitHub for further information or if you have any suggestions
00:43:13 [W] You're also probably give a shout out to sea no cloud in this silver.com.
00:43:22 [W] They're doing some interesting things with k3s, especially from like a manage k3s perspective.
00:43:29 [W] Let's see, so there are a couple of questions.
00:43:31 [W] Sorry Sam. Go ahead.
00:43:36 [W] Yeah just to add on that like the first ever managed k3s so already that's in production phase so like it's in beta as they call, but they are running it for the folks for the developer. So I think
00:43:44 [W] Yes, they are really close to using the trace in production.
00:43:47 [W] There are a couple questions also on how do you kind of solve this from? How do you perform OS updates?
00:43:58 [W] How do you kind of handle this from a you know, remote Edge locations. You can actually do anything with devices when they're bricked or you know, how do you kind of manage that so in my experience what I've seen in the past like I've seen this
00:44:13 [W] wind farms or whatever, you know either when when you have to do an OS update or patching or something like that folks will actually go in like us on a single day or something like that and Patch each of the specific, you know devices kind of running
00:44:28 [W] Not working Etc.
00:44:34 [W] You know that's like a maintenance request that that happens.
00:44:42 [W] It's similar to when you getting your internet installed at home. Like you have a tech actually come out and you know set up all the infrastructure or whatever for it.
00:44:47 [W] There are like there's a bunch of stuff going on with the over-the-air updates, but I don't know if there's any intersection between that and kubenetes just yet.
00:44:56 [W] I think the same principles will probably work over there over there too. But the thing I
00:44:59 [W] to highlight is I haven't seen anything that's you know, whiz-bang e in that field in that field just yet.
00:45:06 [W] Let's see, we probably have time for one more question Sam.
00:45:17 [W] Do you want to touch on like any last minute like how k3s is different from the k8s?
00:45:21 [W] Then we can sign.
00:45:26 [W] Yeah, so like I mentioned that that k3s removes all the like all not all the I would say unnecessary features, but it will remove all the alpha features entry Cloud providers and the storage drivers
00:45:38 [W] I mean trimming down the library the full distribution to or less than 50 in D Minor e so, I mean the code would be complex. And if you go through the code base of kubenetes and you try to go to the code base of k3s, you will find it much more complex, I
00:45:53 [W] But it's trying but it's actually very simple.
00:45:58 [W] Make sense think what 40 minutes so we're probably at the end of our QA, but yeah, feel free to reach out to us. And then more importantly what I would say is if you're doing work in the k3s space.
00:46:17 [W] You know talk about it because I think there's a lot of you know a bunch of questions we have were like, hey, can you give me a reference architectures?
00:46:27 [W] Can you give me how people are actually using this in production?
00:46:29 [W] And so I think the more we talk about it I can get dull, you know, it'll be important.
