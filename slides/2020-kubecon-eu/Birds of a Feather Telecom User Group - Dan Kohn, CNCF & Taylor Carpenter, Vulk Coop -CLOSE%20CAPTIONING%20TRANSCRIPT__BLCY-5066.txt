00:00:00 [W] What kind of?
00:00:15 [W] Welcome to the session.
00:04:40 [W] I'm Taylor Carpenter and I'm going to provide an introduction to cncf Stockholm initiatives.
00:04:40 [W] We'll do a quick summary of each of the initiatives. Look at some of the guiding values including fought knative principles Community collaboration go into some more details about each of the initiatives talk about how you can get involved
00:04:56 [W] time for a QA
00:04:58 [W] cncf would like to help Telco s' and those involved Intel communication industry to navigate the cloud native and open-source lenses cape and assist operators in obtaining the benefits touted by
00:05:15 [W] It started three initiatives the Telecom user group The CNF test bed and the scene of conformance to help reach these goals with its end users.
00:05:31 [W] The Telco music group is a collaborative and open space welcoming operators vendors and Telco M developers to come together to share ideas. Ask questions moistening needs and concerns.
00:05:52 [W] Well as work together right up requirements best practices and do Gap analysis.
00:06:00 [W] It meets regularly once a month on Zoom calls.
00:06:02 [W] And also has discussions on it mailing list.
00:06:07 [W] The cncf testbed is an open source platform tool chain and framework that includes a set of example supporting review of emerging quantitative technology.
00:06:20 [W] Reproducing all of its test results and use cases as well as building new prototypes and reference examples.
00:06:34 [W] The scene of conformance initiative is an open-source test Suite focused on validating cncf and platforms adherence to Cloud native principles with the goal
00:06:44 [W] Creators to identify Solutions and Technologies, which are observing Cloud native capabilities and principles that are important to them.
00:06:54 [W] It also enables CNF developers to demonstrate conformance to Cloud native best practices and provides a set of tools and feedback to help the same developers in improving the software.
00:07:09 [W] They are developing.
00:07:11 [W] Cncf provides a few Telco enfocus meetings, including a weekly developer meeting for the sin of conformance and test bed that meets on Thursdays at 1415 UTC as well as the Telco
00:07:26 [W] Playing meeting which mates on the first Monday at alternating times of fifteen hundred and Eleven Hundred UTC.
00:07:37 [W] You can subscribe to the Telco music Rook mailing list as well as join cncf public slack channels for these initiatives and email myself or daan kaan directly.
00:07:52 [W] We'd welcome your feedback on these initiatives as well. As this introduction will provide the survey Link at the end of the presentation as well.
00:08:03 [W] a little bit about the cloud native guiding principles
00:08:09 [W] These Cloud native principles are built on existing practices processes and principles like those from devops service based architecture in agile software development.
00:08:24 [W] Cncf outlined some of these such as using microservices Amitabh Olympus structure and declarative API is and it's def Mission and how these can allow you to make high impact changes frequently and predictably.
00:08:40 [W] Processes and principles like those from devops service based architecture in agile software development.
00:08:41 [W] Cncf outline some of these such as using microservices immutable infrastructure and declarative API is and it's def Mission and how these can allow you to make high impact changes frequently and predictably.
00:08:42 [W] Just moving a security patch safely and confidently through production.
00:08:46 [W] We have an extensive set of papers on the cloud native principles focused in networking and Telco mom with references.
00:08:59 [W] These allow us to answer questions like how our Cloud knative systems Loosely coupled.
00:09:08 [W] How do you provision immutable infrastructure?
00:09:12 [W] And how do you configure these Cloud native systems once we've defined and identified what we're talking about with these Club knative principles.
00:09:23 [W] can Define what a cloud knative Network function is which is a cloud native application implementing Network functionality.
00:09:28 [W] We expect to consist of one or more microservice and to be developed following clutter principles, like immutable infrastructure declarative configuration apis.
00:09:43 [W] apis it should also have a repeatable deployment process.
00:09:46 [W] A cloud native platform should also follow these type of principles and provide its services in a club knative way like using service Discovery a resource management and fault-tolerant
00:10:03 [W] It should have declarative configuration and the should provide resiliency for the workloads as well as platform and underlying systems.
00:10:15 [W] Another value for these initiatives that is shared as Community collaboration.
00:10:29 [W] So we engage and contribute to communities like those from Linux Foundation networking including their opium Opa NSC verification program or ovhcloud.
00:10:45 [W] And they're testing program or reference certification as well as the platform is service initiative XG Vela and many other cncf in kubenetes initiatives groups and projects.
00:11:02 [W] There's many efforts and initiatives collaborating together across requirements implementation.
00:11:08 [W] testing certification and CNF testbed CNF conformance and Telco Lon user group or providing.
00:11:15 [W] The Upstream value that can be used in many of these communities and projects.
00:11:22 [W] These and use them as needed including directly with operators CNF developers as well as all the way into programs like the VP.
00:11:45 [W] The Telco music group has many members including vendors such as Kong Nokia Intel as well as operators themselves like AT&T Charter China mobile and T-Mobile.
00:12:02 [W] While we're not expecting to do software development.
00:12:08 [W] We have been capturing requirements doing Gap analysis and scoping we've created a white paper called the cloud native thinking for telecommunications, which is in the Telco music group GitHub
00:12:21 [W] Did to the quad knative networking papers as well as in communities like CNT t + OV P where we've provided feedback and direct improvements and the reference architecture requirements looked at Gap analysis
00:12:36 [W] With the reference implementation as well as help provide feedback and learnings that we've had to the cncf kubernative projects from the Telco M communities.
00:12:50 [W] the scene of test bed we have
00:12:55 [W] Many different contributors from different companies and communities like elephants FD iot project Samsung Intel the network servicemeshcon box project from Stan CF.
00:13:09 [W] It's an open-source testbed. It works out of the box for deployments on packet a bare-metal hosting provider.
00:13:23 [W] You can think of the test bed has an innovation review tool its supports using different technology options.
00:13:27 [W] Keeping things as simple as reasonably possible. So you can understand the compare the different parts of the examples as well as an entire environment.
00:13:43 [W] It tries to use Upstream Community tooling as much as possible like keep spray a kubenetes project for bootstrapping kubenetes in a cement from the openfaas project and we try to follow Cloud native principles wherever possible
00:13:55 [W] It all to be repeatable and automatable.
00:14:10 [W] We highlight gaps where we find that difficult or potentially not available in the software and then highlight technology which provides good solutions that meet Club
00:14:26 [W] As I said, it's fully repeatable on packet from scratch.
00:14:39 [W] It currently uses inbound components as much as possible such as how minikube cuddle for the use cases examples Cube spray for the bootstrapping and kubernative knative replacements for many of the host setups if they're available
00:14:48 [W] Awesomesauce cover everything from minimal usage through more extensive use cases and service chaining.
00:14:59 [W] There's Technologies demonstrated like multis SRV Network servicemeshcon.
00:15:02 [W] You can replicate the environment and use cases by going to the testbed create an API key, if you'd like to try your own network functions, you can package them in containers and they should be runnable in the test bed.
00:15:18 [W] Tape or Quest and issues.
00:15:23 [W] they improve the tool chain add new examples support other labs including your own.
00:15:29 [W] You can do that directly on the GitHub page the scene I've can formats has contributors from Samsung Intel and other places.
00:15:41 [W] It's an open-source test Suite based on the kubernative conformance program.
00:15:49 [W] And shows visibility on how well CNS and the underlying platform are following Cloud native principles.
00:15:57 [W] Those test results as we mentioned earlier should help in identifying technology that follows those principles based on what's important to operators or CNF Developers.
00:16:13 [W] The tests themselves are organized into categories based on feedback from end users such as configuration lifecycle install ability and upgradability.
00:16:26 [W] principles like microservices statelessness, which is about how to use data in a cloud native way resilience as well as security
00:16:37 [W] These categories apply to both workloads and platform.
00:16:43 [W] Service stateless all the way up for the resilience or we do some chaos testing on the pods in the containers themselves.
00:16:58 [W] when we take a look at platform tests supporting to say we're starting with a focus on kubernative Space platform, and we expect that the platform will pass kubernative conformance test suite and then from the scene of
00:17:15 [W] The layers so that's add-ons and extensions to the platforms as well as thinking about the underlying hardware and network provisioning and then we look at the integration between all those layers all the way up to the workload.
00:17:30 [W] The requirements for these tests We Gather from many sources thinking about what's valuable to end users.
00:17:43 [W] So we look to see NDT community and the kubernetes reference architecture requirements.
00:17:48 [W] We talk directly to operators and CNF developers. We go to the kubernative community for their best practices.
00:17:55 [W] And then of course return to This Cloud native principles.
00:17:57 [W] Here's an initial set of the platform tests that were working towards it can go into this categories that we mentioned so you can see microservice at the moment.
00:18:08 [W] Does it have some but we have some for compatibility security all the way through to resilience.
00:18:13 [W] We're looking at chaosmesh.
00:18:24 [W] We also include CNF examples such as chord E and S Envoy the EP based IP forwarder and Link here.
00:18:38 [W] Many different packet core examples the Gucci PP a scaling packet Gateway and others which you can see in the documentation link there.
00:18:56 [W] If you'd like to use the scene of tests that we have extensive documentation, including a install guide that starts with a quick start for cncf developers who would like to get feedback on the test results and then more extensive documentation
00:19:14 [W] Developers or source-based installs.
00:19:22 [W] There's also extended documentation on running individual test or test categories documentation going over prerequisites how you can run this in your own kluber Nettie's cluster
00:19:33 [W] And as well as how to use a scene of testbed to start up a cluster and then run the test.
00:19:41 [W] We've included example configurations for testing a cncf which you can copy and modify.
00:19:49 [W] Here's a quick snapshot of workloads has to run and a terminal you should see messages for each test that covers pass or fail a final score. And then all of these results are saved to a log.
00:20:06 [W] The scoring system itself applies to both workloads and platform and it's based on sauna boys kubernative conformance test lie, it has a mo configuration file that applies to each test and the scores.
00:20:21 [W] messages for each test that covers pass or fail a final score and then all of these results are saved to a log
00:20:22 [W] The scoring system itself applies to both workloads and platform and it's based on sauna boys kubernative conformance test lie, it has a uml configuration file that applies to each test and the
00:20:24 [W] You're given as well as a yam all file that's created for the logs covering the test results for each test the categories and then your final score.
00:20:34 [W] This is an upstream set up stream set of test results, which could be used by other initiatives such as elephants OBP to badging program CNT tees RC 2 with testing efforts as well
00:20:50 [W] operators and cncf Developers
00:20:54 [W] If you'd like to get started, we'd love to have help and contributions creating new test.
00:21:02 [W] We have come contributing Doc in addition to the install and usage guides.
00:21:14 [W] We'd like to see pull request for any of the documentation adding new examples or test ideas.
00:21:15 [W] All of these initiatives are going to continue collaborating with communities providing feedback and improvements to the requirement sources helping with implementation efforts.
00:21:32 [W] We hope to provide a cloud native checkbox for testing and batching and then we want to continue to help sharing all of these learnings across the communities.
00:21:40 [W] If you'd like to get involved, we have some upcoming meetings those weekly meetings for the scene of test bed and conformance. The next one will be on Thursday, August 20th at 1415 UTC.
00:22:01 [W] The next Telco music group meeting is Monday, September 7th at 1100 UTC will also be a open networking and Edge Summit on September 30th at 14:45 UTC.
00:22:13 [W] Channels for these initiatives you can email me directly Taylor vote dot Co-op or daan kaan, the Adana Linux Foundation dork. You can also book time to speak with an directly by following this Kalman link.
00:22:35 [W] You can reach us on the GitHub Pages for these initiatives via Twitter.
00:22:44 [W] We'd love to hear your feedback on this introduction to cncf still come initiatives and how we can help you as a Telco moderator or see enough developer.
00:22:56 [W] We'll go to a QA now.
00:22:59 [W] Thank you so much.
00:23:05 [W] Hello.
00:23:35 [W] Hello.
00:23:51 [W] If anyone has any questions, I'm happy to answer here or over in the slot channels.
00:23:51 [W] I'm not seeing any video, but I'm here.
00:24:04 [W] Right Corey asked is the presentation on GitHub.
00:24:29 [W] It's not at the moment, but we could maybe that'd be a good idea to upload. It is across all of the initiatives and they're each one of those have their own GitHub page.
00:24:43 [W] It is published.
00:24:45 [W] The slides are on sketch.
00:24:47 [W] Presentation on GitHub it's not at the moment, but we could maybe that'd be a good idea to upload. It is across all of the initiatives and they're each one of those have their own
00:25:21 [W] Right if there's any other questions if there's no other questions and I can talk with folks on Slack.
00:25:36 [W] I looks like I can post the slides directly into the answer.
00:25:54 [W] I'll do that.
00:25:54 [W] Okay, it looks like Rani Rani. Do you plan to have a release Cadence for the test bed or just a trunk at the moment?
00:26:20 [W] It is just trunk.
00:26:22 [W] The we've talked about releases for some of the components. It may end up being that we need to split it up based on either the examples and
00:26:38 [W] Cases that are part of the scene of test bed and then split that off from a release Cadence for the actual deployment tooling and and the the platform piece though. We've been talking about that but at the
00:26:54 [W] track
00:26:56 [W] Any other questions?
00:27:20 [W] All right.
00:27:50 [W] Well, we can move over to slack.
00:27:53 [W] It's in the maintainer channel the cube can maintain our Channel and you can also reach out on any of the initiative slack channels as well.
00:28:03 [W] Thanks a lot everybody.
00:28:05 [W] Have a good one.
00:28:08 [W] one
00:28:16 [W] All right.
00:28:24 [W] Well, we can move over to slack.
00:28:25 [W] It's in the maintainer channel the cube can maintain our Channel and you can also reach out on any of the initiative slack channels as well.
00:28:26 [W] Thanks a lot everybody.
00:28:26 [W] Have a good one.
