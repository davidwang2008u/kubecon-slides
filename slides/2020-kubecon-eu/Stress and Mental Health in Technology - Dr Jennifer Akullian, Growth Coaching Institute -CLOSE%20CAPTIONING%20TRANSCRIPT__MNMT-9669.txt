00:02:21 [W] Hi everyone.
00:11:14 [W] I am Jenna cool Ian. And today I am going to talk about stress and mental health in technology.
00:11:21 [W] So today I want to cover a few different things kind of a review of mental health that I've spoken about in previous Cuba cons and dive into burnout.
00:11:37 [W] I'd like to share a story about recent experience. I had managing stress.
00:11:39 [W] I'd like to highlight fear stress anxiety and uncertainty and then talk about a long-term approach to improving mental.
00:11:51 [W] - straight Stress Management as well as more actionable tips that we can employ right away and I am really excited to have such a large amount of time at this year's Cube con so that we can do
00:12:05 [W] Bunch of QA.
00:12:08 [W] I'm really looking forward to that.
00:12:09 [W] So I want to start by clarifying something really important. And that is that mental illness is not real and what I mean is the term mental illness is something Society created.
00:12:24 [W] It is not a medical term.
00:12:26 [W] There is no data.
00:12:27 [W] There is no research which is interesting because I found that even very legitimate organizations interchange diagnosed mental health conditions with the term mental illness and it creates a really big stigma around.
00:12:40 [W] And mental health and a lot of shame I point this out because so many professionals and Tech have voice to me frustration and taken offense that their mental health is referred to as an illness and understandably. So
00:12:55 [W] an illness
00:12:58 [W] Every time you read about mental illness the statistics research treatment, what is actually being referred to is a mental health disorder, which is a mental health condition diagnosed by either the DSM-5 or the ICD-10
00:13:15 [W] Knows who the mental health disorder, you must meet defined criteria, which are characteristics that fault or more standard deviations away from the mean and the symptoms must negatively impact your ability to function in one or more areas of your
00:13:30 [W] Our relationships Etc.
00:13:33 [W] I don't necessarily think disorder is much less stigmatizing than Illness, but I feel it is important to understand the language and how it is appropriately used so a quick review.
00:13:47 [W] About one in five individuals are diagnosed with a mental health disorder.
00:13:55 [W] This is worldwide.
00:14:01 [W] So about 22% about 1 in 20 people or 5% are diagnosed with a serious mental health disorder.
00:14:05 [W] I'm very open about falling into this Camp.
00:14:08 [W] I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
00:14:09 [W] It was hard and frustrating to finally get to that diagnosis over a number of years and years and years and I'm not ashamed to share this with
00:14:19 [W] There's because a lot of people can relate I speak about my bipolar diagnosis and what I do to maintain my brain functioning in order to feel normal.
00:14:30 [W] So the others feel comfortable talking about it and seeking help if they need to and ultimately just trying to break down the very real very difficult stigma that keeps people from talking about mental health and their
00:14:41 [W] Reaching out and seeking help when they need it.
00:14:47 [W] So the research on mental health and technology is very limited mental health research in general is very limited because it is not funded mental health and Technology was not given attention till 2016 when open sourcing mental illness began
00:15:03 [W] Their research surveys still it is very limited and there are limitations in though SMI research.
00:15:18 [W] So since you cannot force employees to diagnose or sorry to disclose health information, it is collected via an opt-in survey, which means there is a degree of reporter bias, but it is fair to assume that the prevalence
00:15:27 [W] For health conditions in the tech population is between 20 and 50 percent.
00:15:33 [W] Why are so many professionals and Tech diagnosed with a mental health condition? I get asked this a lot and we don't really know this research hasn't been conducted. But I do have a theory and it is related to dot dot dot
00:15:50 [W] Berto is described as energy loss without recovery.
00:16:00 [W] It happens after long-term exposure to stress and other than burnout other names people refer to it as our adrenal fatigue acute stress disorder
00:16:11 [W] Medical terms what they described is that prolonged period during which your body is in a constant state of fight or flight adaptively. This heightened state was to keep us safe. Our brains must prepare our bodies to run from a predator.
00:16:27 [W] It uses our energy to run rather than to think. The problem is we are not made to exist in a constant state of fight or flight to save ourselves by running from a bear even early civilization didn't need to perpetually live in the
00:16:41 [W] Was to keep us safe. Our brains must prepare our bodies to run from a predator that uses our energy to run rather than to think.
00:16:43 [W] The problem is we are not made to exist in a constant state of fight or flight to save ourselves by running from a bear even early civilization didn't need to perpetually live in the state because early populations were not constantly
00:16:44 [W] Really populations were not constantly being running from a bear or a predator. So the state of burn out after this prolonged exposure to stress is relatively recent understanding in our civilization and when we are
00:16:57 [W] For this prolonged period of time particularly if we do not balance it with restoration.
00:17:06 [W] We begin to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety.
00:17:13 [W] This is research-based and understood. Well in medicine the exposure to ongoing stress leads to diagnosis of depression and anxiety.
00:17:18 [W] So this is why I believe the osm my research suggests individuals and Tech have higher rates of mental health diagnosis, as you can see the mood disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders are reported as the most prevalent
00:17:34 [W] By those working in Tech who completed the survey and consistent with what we understand from research anxiety and depression are comorbid meaning they tend to co-exist together also called that dual diagnosis, which is why you see these numbers not adding up to a hundred percent.
00:17:50 [W] Working in technology is demanding.
00:17:56 [W] Yes few will disagree.
00:17:59 [W] There are high expectations long hours.
00:18:03 [W] The work is cognitively taxing Innovation means there is a high rate of failure.
00:18:07 [W] The stakes are very high. So what can we do to manage it?
00:18:11 [W] What many refer to as self-care is any activity that you do deliberately in order to take care of your mental emotional and physical health?
00:18:27 [W] I consider myself a ninja at self-care and I want to share my experience managing or not managing. So well stress in the end of 2019 and early 2020
00:18:40 [W] 20:19. I started having stress related concerns.
00:18:45 [W] It was undeniably stress consistent with everything we know about stress and how it impacts the brain and body.
00:18:50 [W] I was irritable.
00:18:52 [W] More irritable than usual.
00:18:56 [W] I already have some notable irritability related to the bipolar diagnosis, but I was more irritable than usual and so I started getting help from a therapist to work on that and to kind of just monitor some of the things that I was struggling with.
00:19:09 [W] I also started doing a lot of journaling in the form of letters that I had full intention of sending to all the people I was irritable about but ultimately didn't send them. It was just a way of getting it down on paper and releasing some of that tension.
00:19:22 [W] I also had a last loss of appetite pretty consistent with high stress is a loss of appetite or increased appetite and to manage it.
00:19:37 [W] I did my best to eat healthy.
00:19:40 [W] I started having problems sleeping.
00:19:44 [W] insomnia is a notable indicator of stress something.
00:19:49 [W] I am not used to I mean usually a pretty good consistent sleeper. So to magalix
00:19:52 [W] manage that I really put intention into a strict sleep routine.
00:19:58 [W] I started having somatic discomfort. So it was really really a key and I couldn't really explain it.
00:20:07 [W] I was irritable about but ultimately didn't send them.
00:20:11 [W] It was just a way of getting it down on paper and releasing some of that tension.
00:20:11 [W] I also had a last loss of appetite pretty consistent with high stress is a loss of appetite or increased appetite and to manage it.
00:20:12 [W] I did my best to eat healthy.
00:20:13 [W] I started having problems sleeping.
00:20:13 [W] insomnia is a notable indicator of stress something.
00:20:15 [W] I am not used to I mean usually a pretty good consistent sleeper. So to manage that
00:20:16 [W] Really put intention into a strict sleep routine.
00:20:19 [W] I started having somatic discomfort. So it's really really a key and I couldn't really explain it.
00:20:20 [W] It wasn't because I was exerting myself physically, but I felt just a key all day every day.
00:20:21 [W] So I upped my stretching game.
00:20:21 [W] I'm a big stretcher to begin with but I really made it a regular part of what I did throughout the day and we're going to talk a little bit more about that.
00:20:23 [W] Later.
00:20:24 [W] Oops, hang on.
00:20:29 [W] I can't see my screen.
00:20:32 [W] Hold on, please.
00:20:35 [W] Okay.
00:20:48 [W] anxiety. That's what's up.
00:20:49 [W] What's up next?
00:20:51 [W] Okay, so I started having a lot of anxiety more so than usual.
00:20:57 [W] There we go.
00:21:02 [W] And what I did was practice more mindfulness a lot of more meditation, which I will talk about more in a minute.
00:21:10 [W] We also know that exercise is really great for anxiety, especially anxiety related to stress.
00:21:18 [W] I am not great at exercising but I do have two big dogs way.
00:21:20 [W] About 200 and let's see 270 pounds between the two of them and because that is more than I weigh. It means I need to take several walks a day since I can't walk them together.
00:21:34 [W] So I upped my stretching game.
00:21:40 [W] I'm a big stretcher to begin with but I really made it a regular part of what I did throughout the day and we're going to talk a little bit more about that.
00:21:41 [W] Later.
00:21:41 [W] Oops, hang on.
00:21:41 [W] I can't see my screen.
00:21:41 [W] Hold on, please.
00:21:41 [W] Okay.
00:21:42 [W] anxiety. That's what's up.
00:21:42 [W] What's up next?
00:21:44 [W] Okay, so I started having a lot of anxiety more so than usual.
00:21:44 [W] There we go.
00:21:45 [W] And what I did was practice more mindfulness a lot of more meditation, which I will talk about more in a minute.
00:21:46 [W] We also know that exercise is really great for anxiety, especially anxiety related to stress.
00:21:47 [W] I am not great at exercising but I do have two big dogs way.
00:21:47 [W] Out 200 and let's see 270 pounds between the two of them and because that is more than I weigh. It means I need to take several walks a day since I can't walk them together.
00:21:50 [W] So Bruce and bear gave me plenty of exercise to work on my anxiety while I was struggling with some anxiety my exercise while working on my anxiety.
00:21:51 [W] I also removed caffeine and alcohol something we know helps a lot with anxiety and stress management and
00:21:52 [W] took many many brain breaks, which we will talk about shortly.
00:21:53 [W] I found I started to struggle a lot with concentrating at work. And what I worked on putting more intention into was letting go of the Judgment around that that something was wrong that it wasn't. Okay.
00:22:07 [W] What's wrong with me?
00:22:07 [W] I can't focus.
00:22:09 [W] I'm not doing a good job, which really complicates your ability to focus and concentrate and be productive.
00:22:15 [W] And I worked on letting go.
00:22:18 [W] So then January rolled around and it got harder to manage and became much more concerning.
00:22:29 [W] I found I couldn't function professionally.
00:22:33 [W] I was really really struggling to do my job.
00:22:37 [W] So I worked on letting go and not judging that but I also knew I needed some help.
00:22:47 [W] I realized in January that I had lost sixteen percent of my body weight, which is hugely concerning on the medical side.
00:22:50 [W] So if you lose 10% or more of your body weight in 6 months, you are advised to see a doctor and I lost quite a bit more than that in a much shorter period of time so I knew I needed help my
00:23:04 [W] To a very rapid heart rate all day every day and it didn't seem to matter how much I medicated or two crests or took breaks.
00:23:16 [W] It was still very very high.
00:23:18 [W] So I tried meditating a lot, but when I didn't see it have a big impact on my resting heart rate.
00:23:23 [W] It was very clear. I needed help.
00:23:25 [W] I was also having uncontrollable mood swings from crying to screaming and fell out of my control.
00:23:33 [W] I didn't know what to do and I tried to not judge myself for it.
00:23:39 [W] I knew something wasn't okay.
00:23:40 [W] Something was not working.
00:23:42 [W] I didn't need to beat myself up over it.
00:23:44 [W] But I also knew I needed some help.
00:23:50 [W] Okay. So this is a hard one to share with a big group of people.
00:23:51 [W] I started having suicidal ideations. So suicidal ideations our thoughts about suicide.
00:23:57 [W] I'd without a plan or intent to act on them and not any less concerning.
00:24:05 [W] So what I tried to do is again not judge myself as something is not right and I was failing at managing my stress.
00:24:14 [W] I let go of the Judgment.
00:24:17 [W] I tried to refocus my attention elsewhere.
00:24:23 [W] So I wasn't having these thoughts all day every day and we will talk more about refocusing our attention shortly. And ultimately this was
00:24:25 [W] was the biggest indicator that something was not okay and that I needed help.
00:24:30 [W] psychiatric nurse and in January, I started having these thoughts that he was slipping set it avoids into my drinks not because he's a horrible monster or psychopath but because he was trying to help me he
00:24:49 [W] Struggling so I brought it up with my therapist and she explained to me that she knew who my husband was.
00:25:02 [W] She had worked with him in the past and she assured me that he wasn't the type of individual who would drug their partner.
00:25:09 [W] I got really angry.
00:25:15 [W] I believed that he had convinced her with all of his charm that he wasn't capable of such a thing. So I fired the therapist.
00:25:19 [W] But ultimately she was right it was paranoia and as someone who has never experienced paranoia in my 38 years of life I can tell you that it is terrifying because it feels very very real.
00:25:34 [W] So what could be causing rapid heart rate anxiety weight loss mood swings suicidal thoughts and paranoia.
00:25:45 [W] A few theories. It could be related to my bipolar.
00:25:51 [W] There's something called a mixed episode where you have co-occurring symptoms of depression and Mania at the same time.
00:26:00 [W] It could also be explained by thyroid hormonal problems specifically hyperthyroidism, which wasn't a far stretch because I do have a diagnosed viroid condition that I'm treated for.
00:26:09 [W] weight loss mood swings suicidal thoughts and paranoia
00:26:20 [W] a few theories. It could be related to my bipolar.
00:26:21 [W] There's something called a mixed episode where you have co-occurring symptoms of depression and Mania at the same time.
00:26:21 [W] It could also be explained by thyroid hormonal problems specifically hyperthyroidism, which wasn't a far stretch because I do have a diagnosed viroid condition that I'm treated for.
00:26:23 [W] And unfortunately, yes stress prolonged exposure to high stress without proper recovery can wreak havoc on your mental health and functioning.
00:26:25 [W] It really can be as serious as I just described and experienced at the end of 2019 early 2020.
00:26:29 [W] It is unclear what led to such severe problems for me.
00:26:42 [W] We don't understand the brain well enough and there are any medical tests to tease this apart aside from thyroid test, but it is still a little complicated. I'll save you the details.
00:26:44 [W] But the takeaways that I want you to have from me sharing this story is that if you are a ninja with self-care like I consider myself and you are still struggling you might need some help.
00:27:01 [W] If you can't access self care at all and this is what I see how concerns manifest most in high functioning individuals that I work with in Tech. Is that what most individuals
00:27:16 [W] You are a ninja with self-care like I consider myself and you are still struggling.
00:27:17 [W] You might need some help.
00:27:17 [W] If you can't access self care at all and this is what I see how concerns manifest most in high functioning individuals that I work with in Tech. Is that what most individuals
00:27:18 [W] just can't seem to access it and they internalize and feel shame around the fact that they can't do simple things like exercise or eat healthy or get out of bed do their work reach out for help and
00:27:34 [W] Mental health suffering.
00:27:37 [W] This is why and so if you're struggling to access the things, you know will improve your mental health and that we talked about today.
00:27:46 [W] You might need some help and if you think your partner's drugging you and the therapist is in on it.
00:27:53 [W] You probably need some help. That's a joke.
00:27:55 [W] Okay, so a psychologist working in Tech who I stay connected with recently posted on Twitter something that really resonated with me and it's that people don't go to therapy because they don't know what to
00:28:12 [W] Therapy because they do know what to do and they need help understanding why they're not doing it therapy is one Avenue for help.
00:28:27 [W] If nothing else a good therapist can help point you in the direction of what will get you unstuck.
00:28:28 [W] My Straumann strongest recollection of this very difficult time in my life was the fear fear dominates.
00:28:40 [W] Fear is an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous likely to cause pain or as a threat right now across the world fear is dominating people's lives how we think
00:28:57 [W] fear is an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous likely to cause pain or as a threat right now across the world fear is dominating people's lives how we think what we
00:28:58 [W] The decisions we make fear is debilitating fear is the emotion that leads to suicidal Behavior.
00:29:10 [W] People will go to Great Lengths to stop feeling debilitating fear.
00:29:16 [W] So let's talk about how to make fear are in our emotions. Our servants that is work for us rather than us being servants to them where we feel like we're at the whim of what we are feeling at any given moment.
00:29:25 [W] What happens during stress?
00:29:29 [W] Stress hormones cause you're sorry.
00:29:35 [W] Let's go back.
00:29:40 [W] what happens during stress stress hormones, cause your blood vessels to constrict and divert more attention to your muscles.
00:29:47 [W] So you'll have more strength to fight or flight run from the bear.
00:29:49 [W] This is that adaptive response to keep us safe at directs oxygen headed to the brain to our muscles, which makes it harder to function and work except we are not running from a bear
00:30:02 [W] And when oxygen is redirected to our muscles is taken away.
00:30:08 [W] from what would would be going to our brain.
00:30:13 [W] So the oxygen that is necessary to think rationally problem-solve process information communicate thoughtfully.
00:30:22 [W] Have you ever had trouble getting the words out during a heated discussion that's called word finding which we know from research is inhibited when were under a lot of stress. So the takeaway is that we need to send oxygen back to the brain.
00:30:32 [W] Because again, you are not being chased by a bear.
00:30:36 [W] prolonged exposure to stressful triggers leads to Cellular changes in the hippocampus which leads to an impaired cortisol regulation system which leads to inadequate self-care and decreased frontal cortex functioning which ultimately
00:30:54 [W] inability to manage future stressful triggers
00:30:59 [W] stress also impacts our brain by impacting attention memory perceptions learning word finding like I mentioned they're all impacted when the cortisol functioning is impaired and as you've surely
00:31:14 [W] emotional distress follows
00:31:18 [W] So why are Tech professionals so stressed?
00:31:23 [W] Let's visit a couple of these as well as fear-inducing circumstances that all humans experience equivocal deadlines long hours on call.
00:31:39 [W] high expectations frequent failure and
00:31:44 [W] a global pandemic.
00:31:48 [W] Let's break a couple of these down.
00:31:49 [W] So failure with Innovation comes comes ongoing failure, like we all know like I mentioned previously what are you what you are creating hasn't been done before and countless errors mistakes and failures are part of the process
00:32:05 [W] That I have been working with for years or impacted sometimes too detrimental degree by failure, which is again a necessary component of the professional work and career that they're in later. We will just discuss reframing the feelings.
00:32:22 [W] I want to be clear the feelings associated with failure are valuable.
00:32:27 [W] They motivate us but there is a fine line between when those feelings go from being motivating to damaging.
00:32:33 [W] The world is uncertain the stay over world right now makes this undeniably true.
00:32:41 [W] Certainty creates comfort and uncertainty creates discomfort.
00:32:50 [W] No one wants to be uncomfortable.
00:32:55 [W] We create certainty in our lives to avoid discomfort, especially in today's world.
00:32:58 [W] We live these cushy lives a lot of certainty and safety and comfort but the world is uncertain and with uncertainty comes the fear when we live to avoid discomfort uncertainty when it presents itself
00:33:10 [W] Saying and it leads to anxiety stress fear and panic.
00:33:17 [W] Let's talk about the toilet paper hoarding situation.
00:33:22 [W] It does not make logical sense.
00:33:24 [W] covid is not a GI disease and even if the world were running out of toilet paper, we have ample soft and reusable materials in our possession that can be used to wipe our butts. My husband has lots of comfortable t-shirts.
00:33:36 [W] Toilet paper is a prime example of social Panic you are afraid you don't know what to do.
00:33:45 [W] You see other people who are afraid stocking up on a Year's worth of toilet paper.
00:33:48 [W] So you do the same.
00:33:50 [W] Anxiety and fear go hand in hand extreme anxiety leads to fear but I think anxiety is a lot more simple Than People realize like most emotions what you attend to results in what you feel.
00:34:07 [W] Anxiety and fear go hand in hand extreme anxiety leads to fear but I think anxiety is a lot more simple Than People realize like most emotions what you attend to results in what you feel.
00:34:09 [W] Not attend a wood. It's causing me anxiety the anxiety dissipates because of this reason you must take breaks from attending to the root of the anxiety. You cannot live in a constant state of anxiety fear and fear without eventual burnout you
00:34:23 [W] About the state of the world all day everyday and the secret here is balance balancing where you focus your attention shortly. We will talk about how to do this with brain breaks.
00:34:35 [W] But first in order to fully understand the emotional experience and make your emotions your servants rather than your masters.
00:34:46 [W] You need to understand the cognitive Loop when you are triggered we tend to notice the emotion first, but the trigger does not cause the emotion that is why two different people can experience the same trigger and feel two different emotions.
00:34:58 [W] People in the car getting cut off when someone cuts me off I get red in the face.
00:35:05 [W] I beat my horn ice cream.
00:35:06 [W] I feel angry when my dad gets cut off.
00:35:11 [W] He laughs he feels humoured and why is that it's because it's not the trigger. It is the thought about the trigger.
00:35:21 [W] So for me when I get cut off, I think you could have caused an accident.
00:35:23 [W] Who do you think you are?
00:35:26 [W] How dare you and I'm angry and I beat my horn my dad thinks oh a little
00:35:29 [W] Lady needs to get to wherever she's going.
00:35:33 [W] Yes, please little old lady go right ahead.
00:35:35 [W] And he feels humor and maybe even some compassion.
00:35:40 [W] So if you want to change how you feel, which we want to do only if it is keeping us stuck.
00:35:52 [W] We don't change the trigger because in most cases we can we don't just decide to change the way we feel because this isn't really possible even though I constantly hear things like just be happy.
00:35:59 [W] There's nothing to worry about don't worry about it.
00:36:06 [W] We don't change the way we feel or remove or change the trigger.
00:36:11 [W] We must alter the way we think about the trigger.
00:36:13 [W] In response to triggers over years and decades and the more we reinforce them a certain thought pattern the they the more that the neural connections that create those thoughts are reinforced.
00:36:44 [W] So the stronger and then ultimately the stronger and more immediate they are we all have them one example of mine is that I struggle learning to greet to read when I was growing up when I was in elementary school and I developed a thought pattern story
00:36:58 [W] Smart enough. I had ample opportunity ample triggers to reinforce this story over years and years. And even after I completed a PhD, I still notice these thoughts in my head when people would question my work as a young psychologist or have
00:37:13 [W] Skeptical about you know the work that I was doing so it required a lot of awareness patience and practice but I did change it. It is possible to change the wiring of your brain.
00:37:29 [W] These thought patterns that have kept you stuck on these unhealthy cycles and tracks for years and years and years and it's really not rocket science.
00:37:38 [W] The hardest part is the awareness. So even if it is after the fact and upon reflection rather than in the moment, which is very difficult when you're being
00:37:44 [W] triggered notice what your story or thought was in response to the trigger.
00:37:53 [W] So someone questioned, you know, my my suggestion.
00:37:56 [W] that's the trigger. My story is I'm not smart enough and it made me feel inadequate and insecure and even if it's a day later, I can revisit, you know have awareness notice that story and then all you have to do is revised
00:38:08 [W] Response to the trigger. So someone questioned, you know, my my suggestion.
00:38:09 [W] That's the trigger. My story is I'm not smart enough and it made me feel inadequate and insecure and even if it's a day later, I can revisit, you know have awareness notice that story and then all you have to do is revised the story.
00:38:10 [W] To something that works better is healthier probably more consistent with reality and helps you move forward or approach the situation in a healthier way.
00:38:20 [W] I have plenty of data to suggest.
00:38:22 [W] I have the intellectual ability and training to be the professional that I am that is the reframe and overtime every time I was triggered and I noticed this I'm not smart enough come up and felt insecure and inadequate I would notice it and then
00:38:35 [W] Of I have plenty of data to suggest.
00:38:39 [W] I have the intellectual ability and training to be the professional that I am and if you do this repeatedly, it creates and reinforces a new neural pathway with which time we'll become stronger than the original one.
00:38:53 [W] that is keeping you stuck and eventually after practice practice when you are triggered your brain will go right to the new down the nerve the new neural pathway the alternative story that is healthier and does not keep
00:39:06 [W] keep you stuck.
00:39:07 [W] So a few things to clarify reframing is a tool to get unstuck.
00:39:20 [W] It is an evidence-based approach to changing cognitions that are unhealthy based in heavy research and it is a process that takes time to see the value of reframing is not a teaching technique to avoid uncomfortable.
00:39:29 [W] Be research and it is a process that takes time to see the value of reframing is not a teaching technique to avoid uncomfortable feelings.
00:39:32 [W] It is not pop psychology.
00:39:37 [W] It is not silver lining hard that it's situations fake it till you make it and it is not a magic wand.
00:39:45 [W] So just another example that might be more relatable than my intelligence personal example.
00:39:49 [W] manager gave me hard feedback. This is the
00:39:50 [W] active observation the story is I'm doing a horrible job.
00:39:55 [W] This is my story.
00:40:01 [W] This is the insecurity, you know where my neural neural connections are being made in my brain and this story can be very valuable in motivating to improve and by no means do we want to change that story and not take
00:40:10 [W] back seriously, but if you attend to it to the point of rumination, it can be unhealthy it can cause a great deal of anxiety defeat insecurity imposter syndrome and just keep you stuck one of the many
00:40:26 [W] Really relatable example, is he she they wants to help me grow?
00:40:32 [W] And that brings me to what I consider the ultimate most universal reframe that applies to almost every difficult situation nearly every challenge.
00:40:49 [W] It is healthy. It is motivating. It will improve your communication and relatedness to others. It will improve your mental health your stress management and you're functioning and that is that it's a growth opportunity if you are struggling to
00:41:00 [W] Of a reframe for a difficult situation that you are faced with a great reframe to consider is growth opportunity.
00:41:10 [W] And it takes like I said practice and time to undo the strong neural Pathways that have been reinforced over decades and decades when triggered but it this is something where you can change some deep-rooted patterns.
00:41:27 [W] That might be keeping you stuck in that impostor syndrome when you're actually a very skilled professional that you have a lot of data to suggest you are not an imposter ultimately.
00:41:39 [W] So a global pandemic is a great time to get started to have more awareness and
00:41:43 [W] On your stories and practicing reframing around the unhealthy ones to get unstuck.
00:41:46 [W] But what can we do right now? Good question because reframing takes some time.
00:41:52 [W] So a quick review from last year and if you did not see one of my Cube con talks last year. Please do go ahead and take a look at them post it online. I talked quite a bit about sleep getting outdoors and nature and talking to someone
00:42:09 [W] Bowl things that I promote for mental wellness and Stress Management also, if you're not already completely convinced that diet and exercise are critical to Stress Management Google it
00:42:24 [W] Overwhelming information data science online to prove that this is the case.
00:42:32 [W] So a few actionable tips that we're going to talk about today, and these are all for Stress Management Mental Health brain break stretching mindfulness stacking breathing and tracking.
00:42:48 [W] Okay, Brain Breaks.
00:42:55 [W] These are require awareness.
00:42:58 [W] You must take breaks from what you are thinking about and what is causing stress put your attention somewhere else.
00:43:04 [W] Some people call this distraction.
00:43:07 [W] I call it re focusing your attention on something for a break remember that your emotions are linked to what you were paying attention to.
00:43:17 [W] So if you want to feel less anxiety take a break from the news from social media from what you are working on from routing about ruminating about a difficult situation or conversation or the
00:43:22 [W] Feedback or something that you received or something upcoming that is causing anxiety and stress take a break from focusing on those things.
00:43:36 [W] your brain will recover and allow you to then approached those things in a healthier state in most cases taking a 15 30 minute break from attending to what is leading to a lot of stress and distress that distress
00:43:45 [W] Some people call this distraction.
00:43:46 [W] I call it re focusing your attention on something for a break remember that your emotions are linked to what you were paying attention to.
00:43:46 [W] So if you want to feel less anxiety take a break from the news from social media from what you are working on from routing about ruminating about a difficult situation or conversation or the feedback or something that you received or something upcoming that is causing anxiety and stress
00:43:48 [W] Not lead to a disaster, but it will help you manage the difficult tasks or situation moving forward.
00:43:53 [W] I recommend you schedule it.
00:43:56 [W] So put it on your calendar from 2 to 15. I am taking a brain break and then when you are actually taking the brake and those difficult thoughts pop up worrying about the thing that's on fire that you're working on which it will those things will pop up during your brain
00:44:09 [W] Something wrong or that you're not getting value out of the 15 minute break just notice them when they do and put them aside and know that you can go back at 2:15 after your brain break and worry all about whatever is on Fire or the state
00:44:25 [W] Whatever is using a lot of your energy those will those things will all still be there to 15.
00:44:37 [W] The world is not going to end. If you let go of worrying about it for 15 minutes. Do not underestimate the power of stretching of this simple task of stretching.
00:44:45 [W] Send oxygen back to your Noggin you are not being chased by a bear stretching is an immediate oxygenation oxygenation to your brain.
00:44:57 [W] It will help not just alleviate the stress, but also help your brain function better for the work you have to do you know, because if you're if you're stretching and sending the oxygen back to your brain, then you're going to function better
00:45:11 [W] Think better you're going to just be more productive and thoughtful stretching ultimately can be your brain break two birds one stone.
00:45:22 [W] You can stretch anywhere anytime you always have time to stretch.
00:45:31 [W] I am partial to the full-back extensions.
00:45:36 [W] They feel like the biggest bang for your buck to me this these are some silly illustrations of stair chair yoga chair stretching, but obviously there's tons of yoga and stretching
00:45:46 [W] Suggestions videos pictures online I tend to focus on a couple stretches that I really like and do them throughout the day when I'm taking breaks and then when I get bored of them, I pick two different stretches out.
00:46:01 [W] You don't need to be a full-blown Yogi to get the value of stretching but it is a very immediate helpful thing that you can do to help your brain and to help your Stress Management.
00:46:15 [W] Mindfulness this term is thrown around a lot.
00:46:23 [W] These are the definitions that I like the quality or state of being conscious or aware of something more specifically a mental state achieved by focusing ones Awareness on the present moment while calmly acknowledging and accepting ones
00:46:33 [W] There's that awareness component of mindfulness that I really advocate for.
00:46:43 [W] There are so many ways to practice mindfulness essentially anything you are doing can be a practice in mindfulness. You just need to deeply focus on what is in front of you and it has a lot of value stress
00:46:55 [W] Man controls anxiety promotes emotional health and handses self-awareness improve sleep helps control pain, the helps control pain thing. I think is really interesting that not a lot of people realize reduces blood pressure
00:47:11 [W] And generates kindness and you can do it anywhere anytime.
00:47:17 [W] Like I said.
00:47:18 [W] Mindfulness is basically anything as long as you're paying attention to what you're doing. It can look different for everyone meditation running cooking gardening walking outside playing driving brushing your teeth music reading art
00:47:33 [W] Eating listening dancing podcast TV baths letter-writing showering the activities for which you can practice mindfulness are endless quick
00:47:49 [W] Tip around non-judgmental observation feelings are not good or bad right or wrong.
00:47:59 [W] You just have to observe them. If you think you are not being successful at mindfulness.
00:48:04 [W] I'm guessing judgment is probably hijacking you so if we know that all feelings are valuable and we you know, can can
00:48:13 [W] Remember this for ourselves when we're dealing with difficult emotions.
00:48:24 [W] It will alleviate some of the stress related to having those emotions.
00:48:30 [W] So when we judge these feelings such as anxiety being bad depressed feelings or bad fear is scary and bad.
00:48:31 [W] It just makes them harder to balance.
00:48:35 [W] So let me clarify. We are not trying to change emotions that are hard or just let go of hard feelings. We want to balance them and it's easier to just observe.
00:48:43 [W] I feel anxious.
00:48:45 [W] That's okay then to get lost in.
00:48:47 [W] Oh my God.
00:48:48 [W] I'm anxious.
00:48:49 [W] What is wrong with me?
00:48:50 [W] Why can't I not have these bad feelings?
00:48:55 [W] It's way more added stress than we need. So when you are feeling a lot
00:49:00 [W] When there is a lot of hard things that you're dealing with whether it is difficult interactions at work, a global pandemic or anything in between it is not the best time to bring up everything else.
00:49:12 [W] Weeks in a new role in a new job at a new company.
00:49:32 [W] It's not the best time to ruminate about your choice of careers and questioned repeatedly if you made a mistake, but we do this as humans.
00:49:36 [W] It creates a situation that is much less manageable than focusing on one difficult thing at a time because you can be the master of your emotions stacking happens. When you are the servant other ways other things that people refer to what I
00:49:47 [W] Snowballing catastrophizing when it rains it pours many other silly little names.
00:49:54 [W] So let's do a quick brain break as we wrap up and get into question and answer.
00:50:02 [W] Feel free to close your eyes.
00:50:04 [W] We're just going to take a couple deep breaths together.
00:50:05 [W] breathe in
00:50:10 [W] breathe out.
00:50:14 [W] breathe in
00:50:18 [W] Breathe out.
00:50:23 [W] free then
00:50:27 [W] Breathe out.
00:50:31 [W] The value of what we just did is greater than you probably realize and on that note on the note of deep breaths.
00:50:46 [W] Let's see if you answer yes to any of these.
00:50:50 [W] Do you receive notifications on your computer? Do you receive notifications on your phone? Do you receive notifications on your smart watch?
00:50:58 [W] You're going to have notifications regardless, so why not make them work for you use notifications as a reminder to close your eyes and take a deep breath or two or three nothing will implode in the few seconds. It takes to take a
00:51:14 [W] Refs, however, your brain will be in a better place to attack whatever. The notification is in regards to once you have done that and you know, and I know and everyone watching this knows that you we all received plenty of
00:51:30 [W] In the throughout the day, so let's make them our friends use them to improve our mental health and Stress Management.
00:51:39 [W] Why not?
00:51:45 [W] They already caused a degree of anxiety for most people. Anyway, let's turn them around and make them more valuable.
00:51:46 [W] Tracking the includes goal setting and data review capabilities to report status and progress towards goals over time is hugely valuable stress and mental Wellness are gray areas to track for all the reasons.
00:52:02 [W] We track anything else.
00:52:07 [W] It can be as simple as a scale of one to ten for stress one being no stress at all.
00:52:08 [W] Ten being unbearable stress could barely focus on work.
00:52:14 [W] You can track your stress over time add new management techniques and see if it changes you can see if situations and work or
00:52:21 [W] Life impact your stress as reported using your tracking their endless areas of mental health and Stress Management that can be tracked sleep self-care exercise Behavior productivity Effectiveness and conversations satisfaction with work relationships Etc.
00:52:33 [W] Again endless and there are a lot of awesome tracking apps and software out there research around biofeedback as well as self reporting and tracking is growing and the biggest value. I think is that tracking promotes awareness.
00:52:49 [W] And allows you to watch progress and adjust accordingly, but really awareness.
00:52:55 [W] So final tips for Stress Management and mental health, you must take breaks.
00:53:06 [W] You must take breaks.
00:53:08 [W] You must take breaks.
00:53:09 [W] You must take breaks.
00:53:10 [W] You must take breaks. You must take time off.
00:53:11 [W] And something to remember during a time in the world where fear is dominating whatever you are feeling you are not alone.
00:53:21 [W] You are not alone.
00:53:23 [W] You are not alone.
00:53:24 [W] You are not alone.
00:53:25 [W] You are not alone. You are not alone.
00:53:25 [W] I'm really looking forward to some Q and A. I do not have all of the answers, but I will likely have some thoughts to share.
00:53:37 [W] Thank you so much for joining me today and giving attention to your mental health.
00:53:41 [W] you Cube Kong for inviting me again this year.
00:53:42 [W] Hi everyone.
00:54:02 [W] Thanks so much for joining me today.
00:54:06 [W] I am really looking forward to answering some of the questions that I've already received and answering any additional ones that you have for me at this time real quick.
00:54:15 [W] Real quick.
00:54:21 [W] Okay, so just to clarify around the terminology rumination because I realized this might not be a term.
00:54:52 [W] Everyone is familiar with so this is the Deep were considered saw about something and this is what I call the rabbit hole.
00:54:55 [W] So when we ruminate on something we think about it over and over and over again, it takes a lot of our time a lot of our energy and when it's something that can't necessarily be addressed in the moment or is something that's keeping us.
00:55:07 [W] it can become something that is unhealthy and that we need to move forward from or take breaks from and then come back to so that it does not dominate in our brains and make it so that we can't focus on other things
00:55:24 [W] Framing tip because reframing does take time as I mentioned and it is something that takes practice.
00:55:35 [W] So when we are very connected to something emotionally, it can be really hard to access our prefrontal cortex and think about it in a different way as an outsider.
00:55:44 [W] That's not emotionally attached to the thing. We're thinking about or ruminating about so one of the tips I tell people is to consider yourself a third party Observer. So in order to disconnect from the mmm
00:55:54 [W] Abdullah that emotional attachment to the situation and access the prefrontal cortex.
00:56:01 [W] I find it helpful to consider what someone else would be thinking in that same situation someone you respect admire look up to that ability to disconnect even for a moment can help with the reframing process.
00:56:17 [W] common ruminations and thought patterns that I'm noticing not only myself but as a coach working with a lot of people during these uncertain times and that you might be able to relate to include I don't have the social Outlets travel gym time
00:56:32 [W] Friends that I need right now.
00:56:37 [W] My company is even more financially volatile and therefore so is my job I shouldn't be struggling.
00:56:48 [W] I have more security right now than most people have my relationship is falling apart.
00:56:49 [W] My kids are driving me nuts.
00:56:52 [W] Maybe I shouldn't have even had kids when you notice thoughts like this or you know, these exact thoughts something similar or you just find your brain ruminating again, what might someone else be
00:57:03 [W] Kicking in response to these someone else you respect who you feel approaches difficult situations really well.
00:57:11 [W] And as we move in to QA, I would love if there are certain things that are keeping. You stuck. Any rumination thought patterns, please feel free to send them my way.
00:57:24 [W] I think it's helpful to practice reframing for you for me for everyone else participating right now.
00:57:31 [W] It can be a beneficial part of the process. So, please feel free to throw them out there for us to work through and of course, you can email me at any time if there's a way I can.
00:57:41 [W] Can help talk through these and help get you unstuck.
00:57:47 [W] So let's move into some Q&A.
00:57:51 [W] Got some great questions so far.
00:57:57 [W] Intent or plan to act on it and it does not manifest itself along with any other symptoms great question.
00:58:16 [W] So just to clarify it's considered an ideation a suicidal ideation when there is no plan and there's no intention of acting on it.
00:58:25 [W] So this is what makes it an ideation as opposed to a suicidal thought and so it's it is something that's normal for people to have pop into their head the idea of
00:58:33 [W] of suicide even maybe what it would look like for you and it's not necessarily a red flag unless it is accompanied by a feeling of hopelessness or it is a persistent thought
00:58:48 [W] Case in my example it was accompanied by a strong feeling of hopelessness.
00:58:59 [W] And that is the red flag or if it continued over time something. I was ruminating on that is a red flag. If you occasionally have the thought of suicide pop into your head, you know, it doesn't mean you need to see a doctor or
00:59:08 [W] Pay attention to it notice it and just see if it you know lingers over time or if you are feeling hopeless when you're having those thoughts. So great question. The next question I see is where do people go
00:59:24 [W] So great question. The next question I see is where do people go when they don't know what to do.
00:59:33 [W] This is where I would advise someone to connect with a therapist because they are trained to help figure out what to do when you are struggling if you don't know how to find a therapist start with a doctor or
00:59:40 [W] His start with a doctor or asking for a referral but a doctor should be able to refer you to the right person.
00:59:49 [W] But the point is that if you're struggling you probably need some help.
00:59:50 [W] Next question.
00:59:58 [W] How do you manage to find a good therapist during a time when you are not functioning well and not really capable to take important to make important decisions and how do you differentiate a bad therapists psychologists suicide?
01:00:08 [W] Not really capable to take important to make important decisions and how do you differentiate a bad therapists psychologists suicide pseudoscience pseudo beliefs from a good one
01:00:12 [W] Pseudoscience pseudo beliefs from a good one a science backed and up-to-date therapist.
01:00:17 [W] I get asked this question all the time.
01:00:18 [W] It's a great question is as far as how do you find a therapist in the United States?
01:00:25 [W] There's something called find a therapist offered through Psychology today.
01:00:37 [W] So if you are in the United States and you Google Psychology today find a therapist, you can enter in your ZIP code what you're looking.
01:00:38 [W] for filter out male or female for a specific area that you need help with depression anxiety and a number of different things that you can filter for insurance if you want to go through your insurance, that's where
01:00:54 [W] In the United States outside of the United States.
01:01:01 [W] I'm not really sure what the resources are for finding therapist.
01:01:08 [W] But again, I would start with the doctor because they should have the resources to direct you to as far as finding a good therapist because it's a great question.
01:01:13 [W] There are a lot of not so great therapist.
01:01:14 [W] I can speak to that personally as well as professionally and so I get asked this question a lot.
01:01:23 [W] What I suggest is looking for.
01:01:24 [W] Someone the best suggestion I have is looking for a referral.
01:01:35 [W] So if you have someone in your life who has been working or worked in the past with someone that they have found very useful a referral is a great where to start a great place to start if you don't have a referral what I would say
01:01:43 [W] Is someone with the correct credentials so you want a therapist who either has a PHD a doctorate in the area or a master's degree?
01:01:54 [W] I would not start with someone who is not, you know trained in this area.
01:02:03 [W] It doesn't have the credentials to suggest that they have proper training but aside from that it's really a judgment call meet with someone talk to them over the phone or over email meet with them. Once if you find that they're helpful and you're connecting with
01:02:14 [W] them and what the work that they're doing with you resonates, then that's a good indicator that they might be helpful.
01:02:27 [W] If for any reason your turned off you get the wrong Vibe, you don't like where they're going.
01:02:28 [W] There are plenty of other therapists out there that you can try and it is a trial and error process.
01:02:34 [W] So don't hesitate to move on and look for someone else. If you are not happy with how it's going whether it's the first session or a few weeks in I really
01:02:46 [W] Courage people to you know shop around because it's your mental health.
01:02:51 [W] It's your money.
01:02:57 [W] There are a lot of people out there and you do not need to settle for someone who you don't feel is being helpful.
01:03:00 [W] I'll and error process so don't hesitate to move on and look for someone else. If you are not happy with how it's going whether it's the first session or a few weeks in. I really encourage people to you know shop
01:03:16 [W] So, you know cognitive reframing as a part of cognitive therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT can be appropriate for trauma work and it can also be inappropriate. Sometimes there needs to be some other work up front before you
01:03:29 [W] The ability to focus on your cognitions and so, you know again a professional should be able to talk to you about where you're at and the trauma you've experienced or are still experiencing and help determine.
01:03:45 [W] What is an appropriate approach to working on those issues and maybe it's cognitive work.
01:03:58 [W] Maybe it's something else. So it really really depends on each situation and it's not just for trauma.
01:03:59 [W] It's for other.
01:04:00 [W] You know if someone is very severely depressed and feeling suicidal it might not be appropriate to Dive Right into cognitive reframing because it feels Out Of Reach it's something that you have to have a certain level of functioning to
01:04:15 [W] which is why I use it a lot in the industry of Technology because who I work with tends to be higher functioning and able to access that you know that work around cognitive training
01:04:31 [W] Quite there and you're functioning at a lower level. You might need a different kind of approach to start with great question.
01:04:46 [W] Someone asked what is stacking. So just to clarify stacking is the vocabulary I use for when we pile things on top of each other we're struggling with one thing and then all of a sudden everything else in your life is piling on
01:04:55 [W] Come very overwhelming very quickly.
01:05:02 [W] It can really disabled you from moving forward.
01:05:03 [W] It can be a really really difficult thing to get pulled out of so if you notice something hard in your life is going on and all of a sudden you're considering all of the other things that are also really keeping you stuck.
01:05:17 [W] That might be what I be what Imma Be what I'm referring to what I'm referring to is on one thing at a time because once you get overwhelmed with all
01:05:25 [W] All of the you know difficulties in your life, it becomes really difficult to manage.
01:05:31 [W] Any tip on how to cope with the lack of purpose feeling in the context of working for an organization that does not do anything good at all other than making money at the expense of exploiting people's addictions.
01:05:52 [W] My best recommendation is you leave that company if you have the luxury of looking for another job, then that's you know, take advantage of that and look for a company that you are a better aligned with as far.
01:06:05 [W] Values in this question.
01:06:09 [W] I hear that the values are very misaligned.
01:06:13 [W] So I would recommend for this person to look for something out there that is more aligned with their values. If you don't have the luxury of moving on I think the awareness of knowing that you don't feel
01:06:24 [W] Purpose and you are misaligned can vary be very helpful in considering, you know, the compassion you need for yourself and not getting caught in that spiral that downward spiral. So this is where you're at right now.
01:06:39 [W] It's not ideal and it doesn't mean you're going to be in it forever.
01:06:44 [W] It doesn't mean you need to go down the rabbit hole and ruminate constantly about how your misaligned I think some of those thoughts can be very valuable as you know, I discussed in the presentation today.
01:06:55 [W] I'm not suggesting. They should be ignored and just accepted and you should just move on knowing that there's this misalignment.
01:07:07 [W] So give it some of your attention because it can be motivating to figure out what to do next.
01:07:09 [W] But if you are really stuck in your situation remind yourself that prefrontal cortex that it is not forever.
01:07:17 [W] There are other options, maybe not now but in the future and you're in a difficult situation and you can do the best you can without being caught up.
01:07:25 [W] In this long term, I'm going to be stuck here forever.
01:07:30 [W] This is not something I can manage.
01:07:31 [W] This is a horrible situation.
01:07:33 [W] What is this company doing?
01:07:35 [W] How am I being a part of this?
01:07:36 [W] What is the damage?
01:07:37 [W] I'm creating.
01:07:39 [W] that is the downward spiral the rabbit hole the rumination the cognitive thoughts.
01:07:46 [W] Now but in the future and you're in a difficult situation and you can do the best you can without being caught up in this long term. I'm going to be stuck here forever.
01:07:55 [W] This is not something I can manage.
01:07:55 [W] This is a horrible situation.
01:07:56 [W] What is this company doing?
01:07:56 [W] How am I being a part of this?
01:07:56 [W] What is the damage?
01:07:56 [W] I'm creating.
01:07:56 [W] that is the downward spiral the rabbit hole the rumination the cognitive thoughts that are going to keep you stuck when you
01:07:59 [W] Can step away from that and notice what's going on, which is simply you are misaligned with the values of your company. Then it's easier to access a plan moving forward or at least temporarily let go of the box and
01:08:03 [W] Then it's easier to access a plan moving forward or at least temporarily let go of the faults and you know ruminations that's keeping you so stuck.
01:08:10 [W] in such a short amount of time
01:08:34 [W] When I hear this question what I see is judgment and I don't see the kind of brain break that I'm referring to today.
01:08:46 [W] So if you are taking breaks from the actual work, but you are spending that time thinking about how you know, you're not doing enough not contributing enough not you're not fulfilling your potential not
01:09:00 [W] Missions that's not actually a break that's not doing the work and then judging yourself for not doing the work and all of these thoughts that that are this downward spiral this rubra nation that
01:09:16 [W] Stuck. So in this example, I would say, you know the focus around when you do take breaks from the work actually taking cognitive breaks where your energy and your brain is focused on something.
01:09:31 [W] that's more healing rather than something that is keeping you further stuck, which I read here is the Judgment of I'm not doing enough.
01:09:41 [W] I shouldn't even be taking a break.
01:09:44 [W] I you know, why am I distracting myself? I have more I should be doing.
01:09:46 [W] Doing more and just a side note. When you start hearing yourself. Use these words should or shouldn't there's a lot of judgment in those words.
01:09:57 [W] So if you pay attention to the language that you're using and you notice that a lot of shoulds and shouldn'ts notice that is Judgment step back and try to notice, you know from that third person view of what is actually going on.
01:10:10 [W] Why am I thinking I'm not doing enough.
01:10:15 [W] What is the actual situation?
01:10:17 [W] What's keeping me stuck y-you know what are the expectations?
01:10:23 [W] Why do I not feel like I'm meeting them what's in the way and what can be done practically to move forward whether it's revisiting your expectations or actually making changes in the situation so that you feel
01:10:36 [W] better meeting your own expectations or the expectations of you know, the company or in the environment or the time that you're in and yes, I will validate that taking breaks sounds easy, but it's it's it's
01:10:52 [W] It's something like I said that takes a lot of practice especially when you are taking breaks and they're not actually being used as mindful Brain Breaks.
01:11:08 [W] They are being used more as you know, retreating away from what you feel.
01:11:14 [W] You should be work on and working on and then feeling bad about it because you're judging yourself.
01:11:16 [W] There's a question.
01:11:32 [W] Hi, great talk. Is there something similar to do within a team and if you want to follow up with that question, I'm not quite sure what you mean doing within a team and I probably have a lot of ideas
01:11:43 [W] Like in a teen capacity, but if you wouldn't mind just throwing in another question there regarding what it is you'd like to see happen within a team. That would be great.
01:11:52 [W] Okay, so an example about rumination.
01:12:00 [W] This company is highly political.
01:12:04 [W] I do not fit here.
01:12:06 [W] I don't share or by in at all to the company's Mission.
01:12:12 [W] So again, I'm not suggesting you let go of that and you focus elsewhere.
01:12:17 [W] I think that this kind of thought can be very motivating in you looking for something that is a better fit.
01:12:27 [W] However, if you're thinking about it constantly, it's sucking all of your energy. You can't seem to focus on your family or the work that you're doing. That's when it becomes kind of the rabbit hole that you go down webassembly.
01:12:31 [W] Becomes an unhealthy rumination that keeps you stuck.
01:12:40 [W] If you can give yourself breaks from these thoughts so that you can better approach it with a rational brain through your prefrontal cortex, then you can think about okay.
01:12:46 [W] I've already got the awareness that this is not the right fit.
01:12:48 [W] I don't agree with the company's Mission and what do I want to do about that?
01:12:54 [W] What practically is within my control moving forward and the big piece that people forget is if things are not within your control recognizing this is not in-toto.
01:13:01 [W] My control right now.
01:13:03 [W] And that's okay.
01:13:06 [W] I don't need to judge it.
01:13:11 [W] I don't need to spend days weeks months years feeling bad about it.
01:13:12 [W] Is within my control and I will let go of what is out of my control and this applies to anything in life.
01:13:28 [W] And there are a lot of things in our lives that are with that, you know, not within our control. So ruminating about them and worrying about them constantly is not helpful and keeps us stuck in this example thinking about it and giving it your
01:13:36 [W] Can be very motivating and help you move forward until you realize either you don't have that control or you find something in this case that is going to be a better fit in this case a company fit.
01:13:52 [W] Alright, I have a question. What are effective ways to promote video downtime? The back-to-back sessions now are tough it would be nice to unplug from video sometimes.
01:14:11 [W] Yeah.
01:14:12 [W] I'm not sure if this applies specifically to cube Khan and the video sessions or just back to back meetings all day every day with in your work regardless there needs to be a balance.
01:14:26 [W] I the clients that I work with whether their leaders or ICS.
01:14:29 [W] I hear a lot in coaching sessions that I'm in video calls all day everyday back-to-back meetings and I always challenge that I always ask.
01:14:42 [W] Is there a reason you need to be in every single one of those meetings?
01:14:45 [W] Can you pay attention and track for one week how important each of those meetings is to you?
01:14:51 [W] Can you rate the importance of you being there?
01:14:54 [W] Can you pay attention to which meetings you maybe don't need to be a part of or if you're facilitating meetings. Is there a reason?
01:15:00 [W] But ultimately, you need to give yourself breaks no one can be in video calls all day every day.
01:15:15 [W] it's not possible you were not going to be your best self. You're not going to be the best professional you can be you're not going to feel your best so really evaluating how how you're spending your time and how you
01:15:27 [W] You're not going to feel your best so really evaluating how how you're spending your time and how you can better manage it and even if you only have a few minutes in between calls, you know, if you use them
01:15:34 [W] And even if you only have a few minutes in between calls, you know, if you use them in a way that restores your energy, for example, if you have 5 minutes before between calls or a lunch break go outside.
01:15:43 [W] stretch eat something healthy takes a minute to do something mindful where you are focused on what is in front of you and separate from you know, the chaos of work that you're trying to manage all day is going to be restorative
01:15:59 [W] from you know, the chaos of work that you're trying to manage all day is going to be restorative rather than depleting you but really I would recommend just looking at how that time is being used if you really need to be in that many meetings
01:16:08 [W] need to be in that many meetings if there's a way to reorganize your days so that some days are meeting some days are individual work and just there, you know creative problem solving you all are very creative and
01:16:21 [W] Highly intelligent. And if you apply that to balancing your time and your workload and you know managing your time and your responsibilities get creative because you can figure it out.
01:16:37 [W] You can make it work for you. If you get unstuck from this idea of I don't have any control over this.
01:16:43 [W] What do I do?
01:16:44 [W] It's unmanageable.
01:16:49 [W] Usually we have a little more control around how much time we spend in meetings and it feels like we do and if it doesn't, you know, maybe there needs to
01:16:52 [W] To be consideration of what else can change around, you know work or expectations great question, though.
01:16:59 [W] Any other ruminations that we should work through?
01:17:10 [W] Any other questions these have been great questions.
01:17:14 [W] I hear a lot of Disconnect from the work that you're doing whether it's purpose or you know feeling like the work is valuable or just being misaligned and I know that it's a
01:17:32 [W] Right now to just say well I can just get another job.
01:17:38 [W] I'll just look for another job.
01:17:42 [W] I know that's not the easiest thing to do right now especially so if you really are stuck in a situation where you don't think it's ideal for you.
01:17:50 [W] It's not healthy.
01:17:52 [W] It's not the right fit.
01:17:54 [W] Look at what is within your control?
01:17:57 [W] what options you do have and if you don't have a lot of options, you know, what can you shift whether it's
01:18:02 [W] You know to spend more time outside of work taking more effective Brain Breaks or taking care of yourself or time outside time with family to sort of balance that and letting go letting go is a huge thing and I don't mean
01:18:17 [W] We just accept the situation that you're in that's not great.
01:18:23 [W] That's not what I mean by let go when I say let go I mean let go of the Judgment that this is, you know, something horrible that you're not going to get out of that you did something wrong, but it's not fair these thoughts to a degree can be
01:18:36 [W] When they consume us they can be very very unhealthy and keep us stuck in definitely possibly in a situation.
01:18:51 [W] You know that we don't want to be in or shouldn't be in or is just realy bad for us for years and years and years and this happens with a lot of people all the time.
01:18:58 [W] So pay attention to the thoughts. The awareness is the biggest part. Once you have the awareness and hear what your brain is chattering about decide what to do with that and being a non-judgmental Observer of
01:19:07 [W] That is a huge first step and can be very alleviating of the Stress and Anxiety that follows ruminating about these exact thoughts.
01:19:19 [W] Let's see.
01:19:21 [W] I also had a few questions about where to find last year's talk so Cube Con Europe and Barcelona in 2019 where I spoke in more depth about
01:19:42 [W] Talking to someone being outside in nature.
01:19:47 [W] It is available online coupon has posted that feel free to email me or the staff if you can't seem to find it and yeah that is available out there.
01:20:01 [W] There was another question about using this talk within a company that you are working for and just to throw out there some of the advocacy work that I do around mental health is
01:20:14 [W] speaking on these topics for companies.
01:20:25 [W] So if your company is interested in having something like this this discussion this talk be part of your culture part of the work of taking care of your employees.
01:20:30 [W] Please do reach out.
01:20:33 [W] I'd be happy to talk to you or to someone on your team to see how we could make that happen.
01:20:38 [W] This work. I think is really important.
01:20:41 [W] I think it's really impactful. I'd like to see it happen more
01:20:43 [W] across events and within companies and so if that's something you're interested in bringing
01:20:52 [W] I don't I don't think so.
01:21:27 [W] Not that I'm aware of.
01:21:30 [W] I don't know if there are any tests to test the level of oxygen in your brain.
01:21:42 [W] Our brain and fortunately does not have a great research around it and there's a pretty poor understanding of how everything is working.
01:21:44 [W] So hopefully with better science, we will better understand know how our brain is functioning effectively.
01:21:51 [W] Okay.
01:21:57 [W] Sorry, if you guys are having trouble hearing me. I'm getting feedback that my audio is dropping out.
01:22:03 [W] So again, feel free to email me. If you're not having a question answered.
01:22:11 [W] I'm going to try to go through these Pages quickly since I missed a lot of them thought pattern I get stuck in quite often.
01:22:17 [W] I am behind and should already know the things I am currently hearing ice accession.
01:22:21 [W] I am watching since everyone is amusing amusingly already using all those things for in some
01:22:25 [W] This year's already that here.
01:22:29 [W] I hear some imposter syndrome impostor syndrome is a pretty common thought pattern that people get stuck around and my biggest my best suggestion is to actually look at the real data.
01:22:40 [W] As quickly as you feel you should or want to or other people have expectations around.
01:22:49 [W] How can you move that forward rather than getting stuck in the pattern?
01:22:53 [W] How can we actually address the needs that there are to move forward rather than this downward Rabbit Hole where it just keeps us stuck indefinitely as a team manager.
01:23:07 [W] How can I encourage the team to implement some of the mentioned techniques awesome question just share with them what you learned today the importance of brain breaks the
01:23:15 [W] It's of you know, being non-judgmental and really, you know reaching out for help when you need it taking breaks. I think is a big one. You have to take breaks you have to take time off as I said, so as a manager
01:23:28 [W] Model and what you are doing to take care of yourself is what your teammates will see and what you encourage for yourself encourage for your teammates.
01:23:39 [W] Are the slides available somewhere?
01:23:51 [W] Yes, they're available on the website. If you can't seem to access them.
01:23:52 [W] Please email me Jen at growth coaching Institute dot IO.
01:23:56 [W] Okay.
01:24:10 [W] What can you do when you notice the fellow teammate member is struggling mentally offer to be an ear.
01:24:14 [W] Just ask them how they're doing ask them if they need anything.
01:24:22 [W] It's okay to suggest that you're concerned about them, you know point to data why you're concerned, you know ask if there's anything you can do you obviously can't make people get help.
01:24:30 [W] So be careful around that it can be very discouraging when when someone really pushes for you to get help.
01:24:35 [W] When you don't want it or don't think you need it. So just be a supportive ear, you know ask if they're doing. Okay ask if they need anything ask if there's anything you can do to help and voice that you're concerned if you are that's okay.
01:24:49 [W] Okay, follow up on a previous question.
01:24:54 [W] This is a great mindfulness exercise that I talked about last year and it's called traffic light.
01:25:08 [W] It's an easy thing to do at the beginning of one out one on one's or at the beginning of any team meeting and its really simple.
01:25:15 [W] Where are you on the traffic light green yellow or red red.
01:25:18 [W] I am not doing great yellow.
01:25:19 [W] and green doing great.
01:25:22 [W] You don't have to explain why it's a quick back and forth. You do it as a manager you ask your report to do it at the beginning of the one-on-one. I'm in the
01:25:29 [W] Green you're in the you say that you're in the red you go around the team meeting.
01:25:34 [W] Okay, you're in the red.
01:25:35 [W] You're in the yellow.
01:25:35 [W] you're in the green and that's it.
01:25:44 [W] It's a quick mindful activity. But it also has a lot of value in your teammates or your manager or your report knowing where you're at because if someone's in the red that day and the traffic light, maybe you don't decide that day you give them a bunch of really hard critical
01:25:52 [W] Maybe later in the day you asked and check in and see if they need anything or how they're doing.
01:25:58 [W] So it's a good mindfulness activity.
01:26:01 [W] It's really short.
01:26:05 [W] It's really non-threatening people.
01:26:05 [W] Don't love it.
01:26:09 [W] Usually when you start but if you keep doing it people tend to really really appreciate it and even if people don't you know participate or they just do it because you're including it as part of the one-on-one or the meeting one day.
01:26:19 [W] They will have a hard day. They won't want to talk about it, but they will willingly tell you that they are in the
01:26:25 [W] The red and that will be very valuable for you and the team to be aware of.
01:26:27 [W] There's a question about taking breaks during really intensive tasks.
01:26:50 [W] It can be quite hard to find logical breaking off points when working on more complex technical tasks totally get it and part of that is what keeps us just so exhausted is we don't feel like we can take a break and
01:27:03 [W] Think about the value of actually taking a few minutes to step away because my experiences even though it's not the greatest timing to step away when you come back your brain tends to work better and you tend to be more effective and productive.
01:27:19 [W] So yes, there are some things that you just can't step away from some things on fire, you know, if you step away it will you know implode maybe if that happens consider if you can take 10 seconds to close your eyes
01:27:32 [W] Um, something's on fire. You know, if you step away it will you know implode maybe if that happens consider if you can take 10 seconds to close your eyes and take a deep breath.
01:27:35 [W] I'm guessing that it won't completely implode if you take a few seconds to take a few breaths and that will be very very valuable. Especially if you can't step away and step outside and take a short walk.
01:27:49 [W] understand where that question is coming from though. I'm sure a lot of people can relate.
01:27:52 [W] relate
01:27:53 [W] What channels and slack will I be in?
01:28:00 [W] I don't know.
01:28:08 [W] I'm in the slack channels, but if you don't find me, please email me and I'd be happy to chat whether it's over email, or we can jump on a quick call more than happy to do that Jennifer at growth coaching Institute dot IO
01:28:15 [W] Oh, okay. The slack channel is number sign to - Cube con - Community. Thank you Colleen.
01:28:26 [W] Okay.
01:28:35 [W] Are the slides available somewhere?
01:28:43 [W] Yes their post. They have been posted since before the talk today. So they are available in the where you join different sessions where you have your schedule and calendar.
01:28:57 [W] Sign to - Cube Khan - Community. Thank you Colleen.
01:29:03 [W] Okay.
01:29:03 [W] Are the slides available somewhere?
01:29:03 [W] Yes their post. They have been posted since before the talk today. So they are available in the where you join different sessions where you have your schedule and calendar.
01:29:05 [W] And they are on the schedule on the KCC and ceu website.
01:29:06 [W] Here's a rumination if we have time. Yeah, please call and let me know if we're if we're running out of time another rumination is how can I talk?
01:29:21 [W] How can I talk with people who are idiots at or have zero rationale behind their actions and comments?
01:29:28 [W] Great question. And again, it might be out of your control.
01:29:34 [W] You can do the best you can I encourage you to experiment everyone has a different communication style.
01:29:42 [W] Everyone has a different ability to be rational.
01:29:56 [W] We've all struggled to communicate with different people in our lives whether its family or you know teammates and so look at it as an experiment like okay, I approached so and so this way it blew up in my face, they couldn't you know, they couldn't they
01:29:59 [W] It receives the message.
01:30:02 [W] Let me try it a different way.
01:30:05 [W] And if you try it a bunch of different ways and it still doesn't work, you know ask someone else on your team or your manager how to approach it think to yourself how someone that you really respect, you know a previous boss.
01:30:17 [W] How would they work with this person who seems to really be lacking, you know competence around having a conversation or working together as a team, mate?
01:30:25 [W] Okay, we have one minute.
01:30:29 [W] Previous boss how would they work with this person who seems to really be lacking, you know competence around having a conversation or working together as a team mate. Okay, we have one minute.
01:30:35 [W] Let me see if I missed there were a couple I glazed over because they were really specific and I'd encourage those people. If you didn't have your question answered to please email me because I would be happy to answer those Okay, so
01:30:47 [W] We appreciate all of your questions.
01:30:51 [W] Thanks so much for joining me today.
01:31:04 [W] Thank you for inviting me to this Cube conver Chul event. And please don't hesitate to reach out. If there's anything I can follow up with you on any questions you didn't have answered and I really appreciate
01:31:06 [W] on an area that I think is really critical right now for everyone in technology or otherwise, so, you know, thanks for giving some attention to your you know levels of stress and mental health and I hope you found this valuable and I really look forward to
01:31:22 [W] If there's anything more that I can help with or or engage around discussion with thank you.
