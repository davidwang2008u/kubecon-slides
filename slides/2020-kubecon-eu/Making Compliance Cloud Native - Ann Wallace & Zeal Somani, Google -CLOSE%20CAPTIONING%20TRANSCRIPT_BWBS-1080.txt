00:03:23 [W] Hi, everyone.
00:03:28 [W] Welcome to our session making compliance Cloud native. Thank you coupon.
00:07:28 [W] Thank you.
00:07:33 [W] My name is Zeal and I'm a security and compliance specialist with Google Cloud.
00:07:36 [W] Hi, I'm Anne Wallace security solution manager with Google Cloud.
00:07:39 [W] Thank you Anne.
00:07:42 [W] Thank you Anne.
00:07:52 [W] So today we are going to talk about how to meet compliance requirements in a cloud need to be mainly on containers as we all know that compliance can be quite complex and challenging and it can slow you down on your modernization journey.
00:07:55 [W] So let's understand this problem first whether you are a regulated bank or an e-commerce store running a regulated workloads is quite complex.
00:08:09 [W] Why because you have multiple stakeholders, you have the makers and the checkers the makers which is, you know, mainly your developer community and then the checkers your security folks your risk and compliance folks and then you know legal your workloads have
00:08:22 [W] His requirements and mostly they are Legacy because of this complexity is regulated workloads our slowest to move to the cloud and modernize.
00:08:31 [W] now having said that as these workloads are primed for modernization and to become Cloud up to mised containers and kubernative use our our favorite within our makers Community mainly for two reasons one it enables microservices
00:08:46 [W] Containers and kubermatic used are our favorite within our makers Community mainly for two reasons one it enables microservices and a service-oriented architecture. So you can break apart in large giant monolith into smaller chunks and you can
00:08:53 [W] Monolith into smaller chunks and you can run it, you know at different places giving you better flexibility and Agility.
00:09:00 [W] it allows for multi-cloud and hybrid deployments are Checkers which you know, our security folks are asking Governor governance folks. They love them too because you can inherit a lot of security defaults from your cloud provider and it allows for blue and green deployments
00:09:12 [W] Downtime and to reduce downtime and business continuity risks.
00:09:16 [W] However, not everything is hunky-dory. It compliance conversation is always incomplete without an independent regulator or an auditor which Bones us to regulate really audits which are cyclical seasonal
00:09:32 [W] Regulator or an auditor which Bones us to regulate really audits which are cyclical seasonal and can make our makers and checkers a little anxious.
00:09:37 [W] Why so when you look at when you closely look at an audit, there are two main steps one, you have to scope the audit accurately and you have your evidence the controls with a monolith you basically have you know, one front end one
00:09:51 [W] You basically have you know, one front and one back and then one app server.
00:10:02 [W] So it's really easy to scope scope the monolith or scoop the audit and you know, everything's to control on the chart on a monolith versus As you move as you move towards Microsoft versus with containers. You have these containers running in different Cloud providers.
00:10:08 [W] You enter into a shared responsibility.
00:10:12 [W] It's hard to draw a boundary.
00:10:14 [W] It's hard to evidence the shared responsibility as there are multiple control owners.
00:10:18 [W] This is another why in general audits can be quite daunting because of the things on the left hand side, right? The compliance Frameworks are not cloudevents.
00:10:49 [W] wood
00:10:51 [W] So I've talked a lot about challenges or the problem statement which comes with compliance and you know, it becoming cloudy to their underlying question is what are these compliance requirements?
00:11:06 [W] So what we've done is we've looked at different compliance Frameworks such as PCI DSS.
00:11:10 [W] Nice 853 for fedramp 27001 and what we see is that the compliance requirements fall in one of these five buckets will cover some of these areas in our presentation.
00:11:21 [W] So let's start with segmentation and networking.
00:11:26 [W] It's and that becomes, you know, quite cumbersome.
00:11:47 [W] So let's dig a little bit deeper on you know, what segmentation is and how does it relate to compliance Frameworks with most compliance Frameworks segmentation is really naughty compliance requirement, but it is a best practice.
00:11:58 [W] It is an opportunity for you to demonstrate to your auditor.
00:12:04 [W] What is the in scope worse has out of scope and establish a strong audit boundary when you have proper segmentation and networking controls in place. Your audit will go
00:12:12 [W] Really fast being an auditor myself, you know I asked the first thing that I asked my Oddities is show me your audit boundary with respect to Containers when we speak about segmentation.
00:12:23 [W] It's mainly two types of segmentation segmentation around the cluster which is macro segmentation where you segment the users networks and applications and then segmentation inside the cluster things that you would do inside a cluster to keep your pods isolated.
00:12:36 [W] So let's spend some time understanding the both types of segmentation.
00:12:43 [W] Let's start with cluster networking or cluster segmentation within a cluster. Each part has its own IP to segment the parts use Network policies Network policies work similar to re PC firewall rules so you can
00:12:56 [W] traffic based on IP rules
00:12:59 [W] Building upon that segmentation now you have segmented the pods within the cluster but you further need to demonstrate separation of Dev and test environments versus the Pradhan Were Meant to your auditor you or you need to segment application profiles when one application
00:13:15 [W] I'm in sources the prod environment to your auditor you or you need to segment application profiles where one application contains sensitive information versus other dozen. This is where you use namespaces.
00:13:21 [W] So now lets people to macro segmentation as as you need stronger isolation.
00:13:31 [W] You want to segment your users you want to segment your networks and the application around?
00:13:34 [W] And this is where you could use something like servicemeshcon.
00:13:51 [W] So let's check through the components of a servicemeshcon is your with an example one you have a non you have a network proxy here.
00:14:05 [W] It is Envoy that intercepts the service to service communication. Then you have pilot which runs the control plane number three is mixer that enforces security policies and then number four is seated L that offers
00:14:17 [W] a services
00:14:17 [W] So let's check through the components of a servicemeshcon is your with an example one you have a non you have a network proxy here.
00:14:19 [W] It is Envoy that intercepts the service to service communication. Then you have pilot which runs the control plane number three is mixer that enforces security policies and then number four is Citadel that offers
00:14:21 [W] Authentication via a certificate Authority so, you know architecture lie, this is great.
00:14:24 [W] But what compliance outcomes can be expressed via servicemeshcon?
00:14:47 [W] Be under certain conditions.
00:14:52 [W] You can also end force and TLS for our service to service communication or service to end user communication to ensure encryption and Transit.
00:15:04 [W] So we spoke, you know, we spoke a little bit about servicemeshcon publishes a strong boundary, but how to keep you know, but next step is how to keep the assets inside the boundary
00:15:13 [W] Again, you may be common compliance requirement.
00:15:21 [W] This is where this is where you need to not into your kubernative footprint and you have two options. You can use the manage you can use a manage net from your cloud provider or you can use an open source tool like Calico that integrates well with other servicemeshcon.
00:15:32 [W] Kubernative private cluster.
00:15:37 [W] This is another great feature that allows you to keep things private and important compliance check box in private cluster.
00:15:46 [W] You have two options, you know, you have your connection from Master to note completely private through VPC peering of the cloud provider or you can make that
00:15:58 [W] Where you can allow certain IP addresses to connect to the master.
00:16:07 [W] So this will allow this is really good. Use.
00:16:12 [W] This is a great use case for Broadwater Road Warrior use cases where developers and admins are working remotely and they need to access the master over the internet.
00:16:17 [W] To sum up. This is how you build segmentation in and around the cluster and demonstrate a strong audit boundary.
00:16:32 [W] However, a common question I get is that you know, this is great. Kubernative is great for networking with it is great.
00:16:36 [W] But how do I communicate those controls to my auditor? My auditor does not understand containers and Cloud.
00:16:40 [W] So how do I explain this Concepts to them being an auditor myself?
00:16:44 [W] I can relate to this really well, you know on the other side of the table. This is where I add, you know.
00:16:48 [W] This is where simple diagrams or tools that that lay out. These Concepts well will help and has a section has a separate section on empathizing with Auditors where she covers how simple tool you know, or simple
00:17:03 [W] such a conversation
00:17:05 [W] So let's move on to data protection with data protection.
00:17:12 [W] It's all about, you know, encrypting all things.
00:17:14 [W] Well almost all things everywhere and sure your app is flips validated or fix compliant if there's a need for one and then, you know, if you're using encryption for data protection you you want to have strong Key Management procedures.
00:17:28 [W] So I get over 4 or 4.
00:17:34 [W] for for data in Flight, as I mentioned before a great great control is use of servicemeshcon State you can use the km/s or an HSM from your cloud provider to encrypt tokenize or
00:17:49 [W] Jack to redact on you know mosque your data and then another common area of protection is secrets.
00:17:59 [W] So let's look into it a little bit deeper and deeper. So you might say, you know with kubernetes are the secrets already encrypted in SED. No, they are not because they are Basics T4 and coded and they are not which is not encryption.
00:18:13 [W] One with access to it CD has access to the secrets in plain text, hence.
00:18:23 [W] It is important to protect your kubernative secrets and we recommend to use envelope encryption on will open Krypton is the practice of encrypting data with a with one key, which is called the data encryption key and then you encrypt the that key with a different key.
00:18:35 [W] So we've talked about gene or a data protection and the three areas now, let's quickly go through some must juice as you look at cloudbees Technologies.
00:18:53 [W] So step number one or number one, you know have a time to live on your data beyond your TTL make sure the data is securely deleted especially if the data is residing in the cloud you want to shred the keys and and if it is residing
00:19:06 [W] he's so step number one or number one, you know have a time to live on your data beyond your TTL make sure the data is securely deleted especially if the data is residing in the cloud you want to shred the keys and and
00:19:08 [W] Someone to understand.
00:19:10 [W] How did how the data deletion Works within your cloud provider with your calculator?
00:19:13 [W] Because you will need to explain this to your baby bigger maintain an asset inventory check the data and metadata activity on friend as well as we would with your assets which sits in different clouds number two
00:19:26 [W] As well as you know with your assets which sits in different clubs number two, if the meteorite with the three from here lies with the service possibility as you can zoom key ms&e to some services from your Cloud providers, make sure you also
00:19:34 [W] As you can zoom key msme, just and services from your Cloud providers. Make sure you also understand your responsibilities with respect to fix 140 - to compliance puts 130 - to has different different levels of compliance understand.
00:19:44 [W] Um, you know Brooks won 3-2 has different different levels of compliance understand which encryption module is from the cloud for lighter outfits validated or not.
00:19:54 [W] And lastly to management is the main thing that were Key Management is to set rotation policies for your keys.
00:20:02 [W] using an envelope encryption, if you have Dex and KX you want them to be separate you want to keep as pets at least equally strong or stronger than the deck.
00:20:10 [W] This is all I have and I will pass it on to an
00:20:11 [W] Great.
00:20:14 [W] Thanks to you.
00:20:15 [W] Next slide cook so now we're going to talk about supply chain.
00:20:21 [W] So some of the questions and requirements you'll need to answer with regard to your supply chain are making sure your container images are vulnerability free and sharing the images you deploy to production are trustworthy and then lifecycle management of your containers.
00:20:37 [W] So if we look at the different stages of the software supply chain, first the developer checks code into get than images built and then tests are run.
00:20:50 [W] So as your container images are being built and pushed to your registry.
00:20:52 [W] They might be scanned for known security vulnerabilities and categories based on cve right games.
00:20:58 [W] This is a common compliance requirement. And then at this is the police stage you can use tools like open policy agent or Treatise to create employment policies and denied employment in your environments based on these
00:21:12 [W] Is so let's look at this.
00:21:13 [W] So if we look at the different stages of the software supply chain, first the developer checks code into get than images built and then tests are run.
00:21:15 [W] So as your container images are being built and pushed to your registry.
00:21:16 [W] They might be scanned for known security vulnerabilities and categories based on cve right games.
00:21:16 [W] This is a common compliance requirement and then at the deploy stage you can use tools like open policy agent or Treatise to create deployment policies and denied employment in your environments based on these policies.
00:21:23 [W] He's so let's look at this.
00:21:24 [W] I don't have enough time to dive into all the details of kubernative and Mission controller over or open policy agent, but the tldr is open policy agent or Opa is a cncf project.
00:21:28 [W] It's a policy engine that can be used to enforce policies across multiple parts of your stack such as kubernative terraformer infrastructure as code then API authorization and then an API and Mission controller is a piece of code that intercepts
00:21:39 [W] It's a policy engine that can be used to enforce policies across multiple parts of your stack such as kubernative terraformer infrastructure as code then API authorization and then an API and Mission controller is a piece of code that intercepts
00:21:41 [W] Persistence of that object and then the request is authenticated and authorized these are static and dynamic.
00:21:53 [W] There are some tests there are static and dynamic controllers and we're going to focus on the dynamic controllers are also known as a mission web Explorer.
00:22:02 [W] So if we look at kubernative is with open policy agent first the cube API server sends, it kubenetes object into the webhook request to Opa Opa then evaluates the policies that
00:22:12 [W] has loaded then Opa policies generate an emission review response that is sent back to the API server and minimal response of true or false also note. That policies can be loaded as a config map.
00:22:25 [W] So in the case of PCI, maybe we have an e-commerce store that selling some hipster items will call hipster store.
00:22:39 [W] So they want to make sure that all their load balancer traffic is over Port 443. So they have created a policy.
00:22:44 [W] So on the left, we have an Opa policy written in Rego in a nutshell this checks first if the kind of object B is a service and the request is the operation is create and that the port is not for portworx.
00:22:56 [W] 3 if it is then they deny the request and print an error message. And again, this can be loaded as a config map. And then on the right, we have a load balancer service this would fail when created since it's trying to use port 80 to recap the kubernative.
00:23:11 [W] Figure to query Opa for a mission control decisions when objects like pods or services are created updated or deleted.
00:23:20 [W] So I want to touch on one well technically two more use cases for Opa. They both involve terraform.
00:23:34 [W] So our friends at hipster store use terraform for infrastructure as code to build out the cloud infrastructure.
00:23:44 [W] They want to be able to catch possible problems pre-deployment. But they also want to be able to give their compliance team to way to pre periodically audit terraform State files against their policies and make sure what is running we're has run was in compliant.
00:23:49 [W] in this example
00:23:53 [W] For compliance reasons, they only want their clusters deployed in the EU.
00:24:05 [W] So the rate of course is the input file which is a terraform State file for resources that match Google container cluster and Cecil location if passed the location will have started with the EU.
00:24:09 [W] So now our friends at hipster store have policies for the infrastructure.
00:24:20 [W] They want to make sure our they're using while deploying containers that meet their compliance requirements.
00:24:25 [W] So they make sure that only trusted images are deployed in Survivor minutes to do this are using open source projects for fast and krita's so graffiti. This is a centralized meta knowledge-based with information on one abilities build information Etc.
00:24:35 [W] So now our friends at hipster store have policies for the infrastructure.
00:24:36 [W] They want to make sure our they're using while deploying containers that meet their compliance requirements.
00:24:37 [W] So they make sure that only trusted images are deployed in Survivor minutes to do this are using open source projects for fast and krita's.
00:24:38 [W] So the Thais is a centralized meta knowledge-based with information on one abilities build information Etc build an auditing tools can use a group ASAP. I to store query and retrieve huh?
00:24:40 [W] It's of metadata on software components of all kinds and increased is a kubernetes policy engine that helps real-time enforcement of container policies that deploy time for kubernative clusters based on the attestation of container image properties.
00:24:55 [W] So things like buildpacks and test status and these are typically stored in your PHA has it's worth noting that while criticism kubernative specific project or phase can be used to store more than just container image metadata.
00:25:09 [W] So the greatest
00:25:10 [W] The example on this page shows a policy used to prevent the point of pods with the critical vulnerabilities unless that vulnerability has been whitelisted.
00:25:23 [W] So putting this all together when a developer code is checked into GitHub it triggers a build. And in this case, it's cloudbees Lon Cloud build then generates new container image.
00:25:33 [W] will create a build record that contains information on the image including the location of the source from which the image was built. The vulnerability scan is also done and then a
00:25:40 [W] Also that scan or stored as part of the metadata for that container and Griffey has when a deployment request is made the Pod spec which includes the container that was just built goes to the kubeedge pi server and like Opa
00:25:55 [W] Vulnerabilities unless that vulnerability has been whitelisted.
00:25:56 [W] So putting this all together when a developer code is checked into GitHub it triggers a build in this case is cloudbees lon Cloud build then generates new container image.
00:25:59 [W] It will create a build record that contains information on the image including the location of the source from which the image was built.
00:26:01 [W] The vulnerability scan is also done and then a result of that scan or stored as part of the metadata for that container and growth areas.
00:26:02 [W] When a deployment request is made the Pod spec which includes the container that was just built goes to the kubeedge pi server and like Opa criticism plate isn't a mission controller webicon Cletus checks the policy against the metadata and attestation
00:26:08 [W] Controller webicon Creed is checks the policy against the metadata and attestation stored in your face and either accepts or rejects employment into the Hipster cluster.
00:26:10 [W] Okay, one time security. So runtime security allows you to identify containers acting maliciously and production or any other environment and take action to protect your workloads.
00:26:20 [W] So we just talked about how to validate compliance requirements before you even apply something into production.
00:26:30 [W] But what about post-deployment another we're you did all this work to make sure your containers are going to be secure meet compliance requirements.
00:26:32 [W] But how do you make sure it stays that way?
00:26:32 [W] So when we look at some of the compliance requirements that you need to meet a lot of them say yes, you really need to log all the things but they're very specific things. You need to login monitor.
00:26:46 [W] You need to be able to track events back to the actual user you need to monitor for security events.
00:26:53 [W] And then your logs need to contain information like user event date and time and Etc.
00:26:54 [W] So many logs really don't change significantly for containerize environments. For example Network logs. Look pretty much the same as long as you can tie an IP address back to a single poddisruptionbudgets running on we typically focus on
00:27:10 [W] Skipper Nettie's logs OS logs and application logs. All of these have the concept of audit logs.
00:27:24 [W] So if you're looking to figure out why something is a weight is in your environment who made it that way you're going to use audit logs.
00:27:26 [W] So let's look at these on a little bit more detail.
00:27:27 [W] So kubernative audit logs are actions taken in kubernative you so given a request will generate events at multiple points of life cycle. So when a request is received when a response is started when a risk and when a response is completed the kubeedge pi
00:27:43 [W] Events according to your audit logging policy and then we'll log them and just like other types of logs kubernative is log events can be at a different depth of detail based on the information that's included with them.
00:27:59 [W] So kubernative offers for audit log levels none. So nothing is like that all metadata which logs and meta data only and this includes requesting user timestamp resource and a verb and then request which log the metadata.
00:28:14 [W] Data plus the request body and then request response which logs a metadata rest request response plus the request response body.
00:28:23 [W] So now let's look at all this together.
00:28:28 [W] Where do the logs come from?
00:28:29 [W] And where do they go?
00:28:30 [W] So your infrastructure logs, which are probably your Cloud logs like API calls to your cloud provider come from your cloud provider might go into a central bucket or somewhere else kubernative use logs and
00:28:44 [W] From kubernative Ace and you can use something like fluent D to collect these.
00:28:49 [W] And then OS logs in audit logs and application logs again. These are something that you can collect using fluent d
00:28:58 [W] So if you're running a logging agent yourself you want to send all these logs to a central logging system. And again, you want to get all your logs into a central place.
00:29:10 [W] This makes it easier to filter over all the logs in case of a possible event that has occurred in your environment. This also means you need to be really careful about having consistent identifiers for the same resources across different log types so that you can easily correlate
00:29:23 [W] The easier to filter over all the logs in case of a possible event that has occurred in your environment.
00:29:25 [W] This also means you need to be really careful about having consistent identifiers for the same resources across different log types so that you can easily correlate these events and then you also want to set up a backup of the these logs or some subset of these
00:29:30 [W] And then you also want to set up a backup of the these logs or some subset of these likely based on retention requirements that you have.
00:29:34 [W] Okay?
00:29:37 [W] So audit logs again.
00:29:43 [W] These can be used for analysis purposes and ensure that maybe something like your admins are doing an acting appropriately and then you can push your kubernative and container microservices metrics to something like Prometheus and do a lot of interesting things so you can monitor
00:29:52 [W] Through alert manager on performance metrics CPU memory Network and disk.
00:30:00 [W] So this can really correlate events together. Well
00:30:01 [W] All right.
00:30:16 [W] I was going to spend some time diving into how you can leverage tools like Falco to do runtime checks and detection to confirm your security policies or working or to give you visibility if they fail but I'm not in before I tell you I'm not I encourage you to
00:30:17 [W] No, no Chris nóva or someone else to talk about Falco or talk to some of the other vendors in the container security space.
00:30:31 [W] They all have products that can help with runtime security and most of the products even do compliance checks.
00:30:32 [W] So pivoting a bit and why I didn't go deeper into things like Falco.
00:30:40 [W] I watch past talks that folks gave on containers and different compliance Frameworks mainly PCI, and they mostly evolved around technology.
00:30:49 [W] And honestly, this one was going to as well and then I was bouncing some ideas off my friend Brad for this deck.
00:30:55 [W] And by the way, you should see his Indians talk and he said he asked if I was going to talk about how to talk to an auditor and I said, well, I was going to mention it a wrap up slide, but the more I thought about
00:31:03 [W] The more that we really need to spend more time on that than one slide.
00:31:12 [W] Honestly is the only I could probably spend the whole 35 minutes on it, but I'm sure that cfp would never get selected so you get a few minutes.
00:31:21 [W] So you touched on the importance of diagrams early on but I just want to reiterate it here.
00:31:22 [W] It doesn't really matter.
00:31:23 [W] how called knative bleeding edge or Uber secure your application stack or cloud is if you can't explain it to your auditor, this is why good diagrams are so important so start.
00:31:33 [W] So then you maybe we'll dive a little bit deeper.
00:31:58 [W] And this is where you get into maybe the kubernative and containerd specific network controls. Like Network policies is cri-o and gross configurations Etc.
00:32:05 [W] good to talk about how things are similar and different from like traditional VMS or Data Center deployments and how some of this makes things like infrastructure as code and policies a little bit easier.
00:32:11 [W] All right. I admit yeah moans not that cool.
00:32:19 [W] But as far as compliance goes, yeah, Moe use for declaring your kubernative. Use question get workflow is self-documenting meaning you don't have to do anything differently to drag down who did what when you're change history can be tracked in your
00:32:30 [W] This isn't just for your load balancer changes like this slide. It applies to any changes in your cluster manage the same way.
00:32:42 [W] It is good to walk your auditor through this and show the change history and peer reviews great.
00:32:52 [W] So now the people part of compliance, this is sometimes the hardest part because after all we are all human and change can be hard you need to understand your audience and practice that the and advocacy
00:32:59 [W] So if you're working on developing a cloud native application that needs to meet compliance requirements, the makers are most likely the folks you're working with on a day-to-day basis.
00:33:11 [W] You probably don't need to convince some of the benefits of cloud knative technology, but you can be one of the advocates for the compliance team.
00:33:22 [W] So explain the controls you need to meet and how having clear documentation and diagrams will pay out dividends in the end explain how the get workloads.
00:33:26 [W] They're already using can be used as an audit Trail later.
00:33:28 [W] So it's very important to have precise commit message.
00:33:29 [W] The internal Checkers are the teams whose butts are probably on the line. If you're found out your application does not meet compliance requirements.
00:33:44 [W] There are also less likely to understand Cloud native Technologies, since it's not really part of their day-to-day job.
00:33:47 [W] This is where empathy comes in put yourself in their shoes understand you all work for the same company and ultimately want the same thing to make money from awesome products and keep the company's name of the news from security incidents.
00:33:57 [W] Into your stand-ups or awkward architecture of use and then make them feel part of the team and that their opinion matters, you know, invite them to learning sessions and brown bags and then check in with legal on your diagrams or documentation.
00:34:15 [W] And then lastly the external Checkers. So these are the folks that are least familiar with your application and don't necessarily have the same goals of your internal teams, but they're here to help some monitors like PCI qsa audit systems anywhere from Maine.
00:34:31 [W] You're bleeding edge hipster store.
00:34:40 [W] They need to understand a lot of different technology. And the training is often provided to them doesn't cover anything more than like vm's primarily because compliance Frameworks and trainings were written before containers or even cloud and despite our wonderful
00:34:49 [W] Well, a lot of companies are not using containers. This is where empathy comes in understand where your auditor is coming from, but also know that most folks want to learn and understand new technologies that you're using take the time to explain the concepts or hopefully involving your security your grpc
00:35:05 [W] They paid off and they're doing this for you with the auditor.
00:35:09 [W] So just a side note.
00:35:13 [W] I went to PCI is a training last year.
00:35:15 [W] Let's just say my eyes are really open.
00:35:20 [W] The trainer's couldn't answer a lot of my questions when it came to PCI and containers and because of this Zealand I have been actively involved with PCI Council and we're working with them and other Cloud providers on better documentation and cloud training.
00:35:30 [W] So the tldr on this presentation and yes, we could have started with this but you might not have stayed is kubernative in Cloud native makes compliance a lot easier in places in some places like logs.
00:35:42 [W] It's pretty much the same teach people what you know, make Cloud native security compliance less scary and then automate things including infrastructure as code and policy is closed as much as you can because this will make complaints less burdensome and then
00:35:57 [W] Says in some places like logs.
00:35:58 [W] It's pretty much the same teach people what you know, make Cloud native security compliance list gery and then automate things including infrastructure as code and policy is closed as much as you can because this will make complaints less burdensome and then
00:35:59 [W] Model between you and your cloud provider, and we're here to help if you have any questions.
00:36:03 [W] Thank you.
00:36:04 [W] Hi.
00:36:20 [W] So I think in my life.
00:36:25 [W] Can you all hear me?
00:36:42 [W] Yes, okay.
00:36:43 [W] Alright. Okay. So there's been quite a few questions about our slides apologies for the quality of the recording.
00:36:57 [W] I didn't realize it was so bad.
00:37:01 [W] I think the the slides will be available on schedule app later if they're not well.
00:37:07 [W] Work with Cube condo, make sure they are available.
00:37:14 [W] So yes apologies there.
00:37:15 [W] So ZL. I think the first question was for you.
00:37:22 [W] Where's the question?
00:37:23 [W] Where are the questions?
00:37:25 [W] Y'all hear me?
00:37:31 [W] Yes.
00:37:31 [W] Okay.
00:37:31 [W] Alright. Okay. So there's been quite a few questions about our slides apologies for the quality of the recording.
00:37:34 [W] I didn't realize it was so bad.
00:37:35 [W] I think the the slides will be available on schedule app later if they're not will work with.
00:37:37 [W] You can to make sure they are available.
00:37:38 [W] So yes apologies there.
00:37:38 [W] So zo I think the first question was for you.
00:37:38 [W] Where's the question?
00:37:39 [W] Where are the questions?
00:37:39 [W] How do I so the first question was traditionally in data centers folks used IPS like Palo Alto to inspect app traffic.
00:37:40 [W] How can we do the same and kubernative?
00:37:40 [W] So so I know we offer Google offers packet mirroring and with packet mirror and you can tie that into your ids/ips.
00:37:53 [W] So that's one option.
00:37:56 [W] I'm not sure what the other Cloud providers offer in that area.
00:37:59 [W] I don't know Zeal if you have a other answer to that one and no, I mean it really Remains the Same, right? So so the main intent for idea IPS IDs
00:38:10 [W] is to you know, inspect your knots out traffic and your East-West traffic it is still a network level control.
00:38:25 [W] So whether you know your application is containerized or whether it is running on a VM it is it's pretty much the same you want to you want to look at the traffic you want to look at the network level traffic and to answer Point earlier at
00:38:32 [W] Yes, like Palo Alto to inspect app traffic.
00:38:34 [W] How can we do the same and kubernative?
00:38:34 [W] So so I know we offer Google offers packet mirroring and with packet Mary and you can tie that into your ids/ips.
00:38:37 [W] So that's one option.
00:38:37 [W] I'm not sure what the other Cloud providers offer in that area.
00:38:38 [W] I don't know Zeal if you have a other answer to that one and no, I mean it really Remains the Same, right? So so the main intent for idea IP SIDS is
00:38:42 [W] Do you know inspect your not stop traffic and your East-West traffic?
00:38:46 [W] It is still a network level control.
00:38:47 [W] So whether you know your application is containerized or whether it is running on a VM it is it's pretty much the same you want to you want to look at the traffic you want to look at the network level traffic and to answer Point earlier at Google
00:38:49 [W] Even gke and you know, look at your traffic going east west north south.
00:38:50 [W] You'll have to you know, take the traffic you you'll have to the once but traffic is piped you you can run your own analytics or you know, you can take it to a tool like Palo Alto.
00:39:01 [W] Thank you got cut off.
00:39:10 [W] Okay, so I joined late this group fast and create a center great with Harbor registry or kubernative distributions like openshift.
00:39:27 [W] Yes, you can you I mean they're open source, so they are independent of platforms.
00:39:31 [W] So, yes, you can use those.
00:39:35 [W] I'm not familiar with Harbor registry, but I don't see why it would not work.
00:39:37 [W] So the next question is a good question.
00:39:47 [W] What's the difference between kritis and open policy agent? So they're both policy policy enforcers
00:39:56 [W] Use open policy agent for validating the kubernative config.
00:40:09 [W] So to make sure that you know, somebody doesn't deploy a container or some content config that is not something that we wanted with criticized. I have used that.
00:40:19 [W] I'm sorry more for container images. So using graffiti house as a meta data store you validate things like the
00:40:26 [W] the making sure that severity High images don't get deployed.
00:40:36 [W] And then the second part of this question is is there an option to integrate Opa with graffiti has I haven't personally seen it but Opa is pretty flexible.
00:40:45 [W] Maybe there is I mean your face can be used for a lot of things outside of kubernative.
00:40:51 [W] I honestly just haven't seen that done.
00:40:53 [W] So I'm not sure but I will look into
00:40:56 [W] That is C. So the next question.
00:41:08 [W] Is there any automated tools for compliance verification?
00:41:09 [W] Do you want to take that one zero?
00:41:11 [W] Yes.
00:41:14 [W] So again not going into Iraq.
00:41:15 [W] in general in yours
00:41:19 [W] You might out go ahead.
00:41:21 [W] Maybe I can turn on my phone. Is this better?
00:41:28 [W] Yeah.
00:41:34 [W] Yeah Sue most Cloud providers.
00:41:37 [W] you know, they have some sort of some sort of tools such as suicide Google.
00:41:45 [W] We have the cloud security Command Center and within Cloud security Command Center.
00:41:47 [W] There's a feature called Shah shock and look at you know, different configurations. So infrastructure level configurations and can and can you know emit signals or can give you results whether
00:41:59 [W] The infrastructure has been configured to meet the compliance check and that's that's a great tool. If you know if you're running your applications on Google Cloud for compliance verification.
00:42:13 [W] Shannon does that help?
00:42:14 [W] Yeah and twist lock aqua seccomp.
00:42:40 [W] Okay.
00:42:51 [W] so
00:42:54 [W] next question. What should yeah, this is it.
00:43:06 [W] what should be included in the asset inventory for kubernative cluster?
00:43:14 [W] so the biggest difference between you know, we M's and and clusters kubernative clusters is that we emza run for for a longer period of time and you know, you versus cluster they come and go what
00:43:30 [W] Being a past auditor. I would like to see at least you know, the IP space that is given to the to the cluster. What what is the how do you do how a different what
00:43:47 [W] Occation teams are accessing the cluster so, you know cluster owner or you know the team that's that manages the cluster owns the cluster and of course the IP spaces.
00:44:00 [W] Moving on. Is there any integration between Falco and security Command Center for intrusion prevention?
00:44:13 [W] Yes, they're very there is integration between Falco and Cloud security Command Center.
00:44:29 [W] I think there is a blog post on sysdig about that.
00:44:31 [W] I recall seeing that maybe last year.
00:44:33 [W] Okay, any recommendations and thoughts on Checkers EG security involvement and policy is code.
00:44:51 [W] Yeah, I mean any recommendations and thoughts on Checkers.
00:45:03 [W] I mean, I think probably time for 100. Sorry. Okay, thoughts on this Zeal. I mean II think security should be involved with policy is code.
00:45:13 [W] I think these should be reviewed with the policy teams.
00:45:15 [W] I think it's a kind of a shared responsibility model between the development teams who might be writing these and the security teams.
00:45:25 [W] Yeah, you want you want you certainly want to security as a key check when you express a when you shift left when you express your confide a compliance configurations as as scored.
00:45:36 [W] You definitely want, you know security as a get a checker. I would actually encourage, you know, even your compliance folks, you know,
00:45:44 [W] I think you cut out again seal.
00:45:51 [W] Folks who you know interact with your Auditors on a frequent basis you want them to be involved as early as possible as part of that gate check.
00:46:04 [W] And then as far as if you're actually talking about policies that you shall write involvement, we there's a lot of examples out there.
00:46:16 [W] I just got part of slides will be made available later through Cube Khan.
00:46:24 [W] So one may think we just won we just got notified that we need.
00:46:25 [W] that was the last question, but we can move everything to slack and happy to answer more questions.
00:46:33 [W] and then again will work and make sure that our slides are available through the
00:46:37 [W] usually nap
00:46:38 [W] Well, thank you everybody.
00:46:45 [W] You appreciated this and thank you for dealing with our technical difficulties.
00:46:49 [W] But yeah, we'll get we'll get things posted.
00:46:50 [W] So thank you.
00:46:51 [W] Thank you.
00:46:51 [W] Thank you everyone. Thank you Coop gone.
