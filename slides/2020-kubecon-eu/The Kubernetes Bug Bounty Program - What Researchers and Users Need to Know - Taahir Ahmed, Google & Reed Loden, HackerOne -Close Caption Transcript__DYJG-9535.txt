00:02:53 [W] Hi welcome.
00:02:59 [W] We're going to be talking to you today about the kubenetes bug Bounty program what researchers and users need to know?
00:03:02 [W] But first off, who are we my name is Tha here. I work on the GK security team at Google.
00:03:19 [W] The reason why I'm kind of close to this subject is that in general the GK security team kind of consumes the output of this process.
00:03:22 [W] So we handle our security incidents based off communities open source security incidents and to introduce himself.
00:03:27 [W] Let's go over to read.
00:03:29 [W] Hi everybody.
00:03:33 [W] My name is Reed London.
00:03:35 [W] I deal with open source security and hacker one and to kick it off. Now. Let's say I go back to here.
00:03:39 [W] So in this presentation, we're got a couple objectives for you.
00:03:49 [W] We've helpfully frame them in terms of questions here.
00:03:54 [W] We would like you to understand what is hacking who are hackers.
00:03:57 [W] What is a bug Bounty program?
00:04:00 [W] How does the kubernative security process work?
00:04:02 [W] what happens when a security vulnerability is reported in communities and what can you as a user or administrator or contributor to kubenetes do to help out kubenetes security?
00:04:12 [W] Then to take us to the definition of hacker. I'm going to hand it over to read.
00:04:19 [W] So first of all, since we're going to talk about hackers, let's actually Define the term hacker. There's a lot of misconceptions about what hackers are and are not
00:04:31 [W] If we start a search to see what the public thinks about hackers, it's not great.
00:04:38 [W] You know, you see the instant search results here.
00:04:40 [W] These are what people are actually searching for and in fact, if you do an image search, it seems all hackers wear hoodies and like they have this glowing green code emits. Just Matrix behind them.
00:04:51 [W] They're bent over their laptop typing. It's all pretty dramatic and we just we definitely know that this is just not the case.
00:04:58 [W] So what is a hacker, you know often the word has negative connotations, but it hacker one. We believe in hacking for good.
00:05:06 [W] There are many other names for hackers think of security researcher perhaps finder but simply we believe that a hacker can be defined as someone who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations.
00:05:19 [W] So how exactly do you work with actors?
00:05:24 [W] Well, there's basically kind of three different ways.
00:05:30 [W] Let's start with the simplest form.
00:05:31 [W] It's called vulnerability coordination.
00:05:34 [W] It's a much more reactive approach by publishing a process that informs people outside your organization what to do and they, you know, discover a potential security issue.
00:05:46 [W] It is basically saying like hey, if you find something, let us know the US Department of Defense calls this the see something say something model of the digital world.
00:05:58 [W] I'm you can see this is starting the process of welcoming hacker. So letting out the welcome mat for hackers, but more increasingly.
00:06:04 [W] I see wonderfully coordination getting required for compliance and certain initiatives FrontRunner would be the automotive industry healthcare industry and even the government as well a step up is hacker powered Pinterest.
00:06:12 [W] Test so the key Point here is the diverse set of testers.
00:06:20 [W] Every time you run one of these pin tests, you get a completely different set of a leak experienced hackers making sure that you're reaping the benefits of many eyes.
00:06:32 [W] Obviously, this is a much more proactive way of doing things since you're you know, actually taking charge and doing something but it could be required as part of a compliance or vendor assessment effort you get your results almost instantly as they come in
00:06:42 [W] As reports come in.
00:06:44 [W] There's no need to wait for weeks for a final report.
00:06:48 [W] You can see things as have it and you can go actually go ahead and get started fixing things and finally on bug Bounty programs a bug Bounty is an extension to both of the previous methods you're taking it to the next level here by actively incentivizing the largest
00:07:00 [W] Hackers in the world to perform basically continuous security research on your products and services you're offering, you know large cash rewards for valid vulnerabilities.
00:07:13 [W] It's obviously the most practive approach and it's also one of the best ways for your own Engineers to learn to security.
00:07:21 [W] There's no better way from learning than getting practical examples of mistakes that you and your teammates have made.
00:07:26 [W] And if you're doing penetration tests, whether these be hacker powered Pinterest or you know, standard head coach like consultancy firm based tests the bug Bounty program can let you better tailor those pin test. So say your bug Bounty
00:07:40 [W] Receiving a bunch of reports on a particular area within you could laser focus your PIN tests on to that area to knock out an entire class of vulnerabilities from prevent those features ports at the same time if you're not getting
00:07:55 [W] Reports in your program on an area the maybe that's a case where like hey, you know the hackers not finding something here.
00:08:04 [W] Let's use our pin tests, you know funds to like actually make sure there's not an issue in this segment has a separate set of code, but it again allows you to focus those Pinterest you're not duplicating things. You're getting value out of both of them, but
00:08:17 [W] Importantly, it's the cherry on top of your Software System development lifecycle. So again, what we're going to talk about today is a bug Bounty program specifically for kubernative.
00:08:27 [W] and over to here
00:08:30 [W] So let's get into the specifics of kubenetes.
00:08:41 [W] So to really talk about anything related to kubenetes security.
00:08:44 [W] We have to introduce you to the product security committee.
00:08:48 [W] They're the One Stop Shop for all your security related issues in kubenetes.
00:08:52 [W] It's a business hours on-call Rotation by community members. Although it's not really that communities expecting these people to do it out of the goodness of their heart and Jim roll. This is something they do as part of their
00:09:02 [W] Job, and it forms a pretty significant chunk of their day job.
00:09:13 [W] So in the on-call rotation that person is currently on called triages incoming security reports both from the hacker one kubenetes bug Bounty program and from directly to the security at kubenetes. Thought I oh I'm a linguist.
00:09:20 [W] Currently on called triage is incoming security reports both from the hacker one kubenetes bug Bounty program and from directly to the security at kubenetes. Thought I oh male enlist valid reports are handled as security incidents and we'll go
00:09:25 [W] process that that entails
00:09:28 [W] so why what was the original motivation for wanting a bug Bounty program for Cuba Nettie's?
00:09:38 [W] So got kicked off a couple years ago at this point and some of the original motivations were to get more security researcher attention in General on the kubenetes code base simplify the triage in response process
00:09:51 [W] His product security committee show that enterprises sorry sure. That kubenetes is Enterprise ready. So one of the ways you really demonstrate that your product is Battle tested and ready to go is
00:10:07 [W] comprehensive security story around it
00:10:10 [W] widen the net of contributors to kubenetes security both in terms of finding external security researchers and incentivizing them to look at kubenetes, but also in synthesizing normal contributors who would not necessarily think of them as having security skills to Think Through the
00:10:27 [W] Of the bugs and features that they're handling and an additional motivation was to define a way to get security coverage on kubenetes Project infrastructure, like the prow continuous integration the chat the websites
00:10:42 [W] Without a bug Bounty program.
00:10:49 [W] It's not really the case that you get a lot of people taking a look at those.
00:10:50 [W] So now suppose a vulnerability does get submitted what happens now in its raw form. So this is a pretty good report, but
00:11:04 [W] They can reports have varying quality when they come in fortunately for the people on the PSC as read will take us through.
00:11:12 [W] You know hack-a-thon triage workflow.
00:11:25 [W] So what happens basically when a report comes in hackers submits a report on hacker one.com / kubernative.
00:11:30 [W] He's that report goes in to an initial kind of triage Q hacker one has a set of security analysts and said number of them actually have kubernative straining certified training, so
00:11:40 [W] You know hack-a-thon triage workflow.
00:11:41 [W] So what happens basically when the report comes in hackers submits a report on hacker one.com / kubernative.
00:11:42 [W] He's that report goes in to an initial kind of triage Q hacker one has a set of security analysts and said number of them actually have kubernative straining certified training, so
00:11:43 [W] Nettie's they have some infrastructure that they can spin out its kind of test the submitted vulnerability they will do what they can to validate the issue including going back and forth with the hacker to see if any more information is needed and once they've been able to
00:11:55 [W] You then they'll go ahead and assign a what they think is severity cwe which is a kind of the vulnerability type that it is and do a short ride up of what the issue is. Once that's been done then
00:12:11 [W] It is and do a short ride up of what the issue is. Once that's been done then they will Market officially as triage and they'll also go ahead and kick it back to the kick it over to the kubernative spok security committee
00:12:20 [W] And it'll also go ahead and kick it back to the kick it over to the kubernative a spark security committee to take next steps but to hear we'll be talking about.
00:12:24 [W] Okay. So once this report is triage by a hacker one by their triage agents, then the PSC on called.
00:12:36 [W] We'll take a look at it.
00:12:37 [W] They will probably do their own reproduction to try and understand how serious the issue is. And if it is determined to be an actual issue what happens next is someone on the PSC will step up as a
00:12:51 [W] six lead so that's a single point of contact who is responsible for shepherding the fixed for the issue through its creation handling the communication plan about the the issue and just generally having the responsibility
00:13:06 [W] And it gets handled properly.
00:13:08 [W] So once the fix leaders chosen, the next step is to for them to assemble a fixed team kubenetes is a huge code base.
00:13:24 [W] It's vanishingly unlikely that the fix lead is an expert or even familiar with the part of the code base that's affected.
00:13:30 [W] So their first job is to assemble people who are experts in that part of the code and bring them up to speed on the issue and get them in agreement on how to fix it.
00:13:37 [W] Then for the next chunk of time, the fix team will work on developing the fix so that might happen privately in a private GitHub repo or it might happen semi publicly depending on the severity of the issue.
00:13:54 [W] So semi publicly would be the commits go into kubenetes main line, but they're not the commit descriptions.
00:14:00 [W] Don't say things like, oh my gosh.
00:14:01 [W] This is a giant security issue. They just say fix this or that
00:14:04 [W] So this part of the timeline can be variable from days in the case of an extremely secure an extremely serious vulnerability two weeks if it's just sort of like a
00:14:20 [W] Low severity vulnerability in the meantime. The fix lead is working on developing the communications plan for the issue.
00:14:35 [W] So that will be like, how do we explain this issue to users and administrators of kubenetes and
00:14:40 [W] make it clear what action they need to take.
00:14:43 [W] After the communications plan is put together.
00:14:52 [W] The next step is to notify the distributor's list.
00:14:55 [W] The distributor's list is a group of vendors who offer certified kubenetes distributions to customers outside of their own organizations.
00:15:06 [W] So that covers Cloud providers like Google Amazon and Microsoft as well as vendors who provide a distribution of kubenetes rather than a kubenetes as a service.
00:15:15 [W] They need that advance notice to work through their own security response pipelines.
00:15:26 [W] So they need to be ready to take whatever patch is kubenetes provides and have a plan for deploying them and they may need to plan for near-term remediation depending on the seriousness of the issue.
00:15:36 [W] So then the next step is once the fix is ready to go.
00:15:45 [W] It needs to be merged and released this can either for high security vulnerabilities.
00:15:50 [W] Or for medium or low you will tend to catch the existing Release Train of an existing patch version.
00:15:58 [W] Once the fix is merged and released and there are new kubernative builds available.
00:16:09 [W] Then the public notification goes out that says this is the issue.
00:16:10 [W] This is what you need to do.
00:16:11 [W] Come get this new release and do these things to fix the problem that goes as out as a wide blast to most of the kubenetes announcement channels.
00:16:22 [W] So slack that kubenetes announced mailing list and so on.
00:16:25 [W] So that's kind of the end to end vulnerability response process now, I'll hand it off to read to talk through some of the metrics of the program so far.
00:16:33 [W] Sure, so the program launched in January of this year.
00:16:42 [W] It is already paid out almost $15,000 in bounties.
00:16:49 [W] The top Bounty awarded to an individual hacker is five thousand so far. There have been 80 plus valid reports that have been submitted from 24 unique hackers so that this is
00:16:59 [W] Only halfway through the craziest year of our lives and we're already seeing a lot of great reports that have come in.
00:17:08 [W] so over to here for next
00:17:11 [W] Yeah, so there's been lots of great vulnerabilities.
00:17:16 [W] Well, great or not interesting vulnerabilities coming in through the program.
00:17:25 [W] In fact, the rate of reports is ticked up since launching the bug got me bug Bounty program.
00:17:36 [W] Some of that may be due to people who get pronounce the bug Bounty program. And so it's possible that people were sitting on their vulnerabilities until the bug Bounty program is open, but hopefully it's also reflective
00:17:41 [W] wider coverage
00:17:43 [W] some highlights that you may have recognized recently from your own inbox would be these two cves that recently had security notifications go out.
00:17:57 [W] I won't go into the specifics of them. But if there's questions we can address them after the talk.
00:18:00 [W] So now all this is well and good.
00:18:05 [W] But what does it mean for you?
00:18:10 [W] Whether you're a user if you were Nettie's and administrative or communities cluster or an existing code contributor to kubenetes?
00:18:14 [W] Anyone can contribute to kubenetes security. You don't need to be a security wizard.
00:18:22 [W] You don't even need to think of yourself as having security skills.
00:18:25 [W] The general way it works.
00:18:32 [W] Is that security bugs often start out as normal bugs. Someone noticed that something was broken and it was only after further reflection or further thought.
00:18:34 [W] That the security aspect becomes clear.
00:18:49 [W] So as a contributor to communities if you're reporting a bug or fixing a bug just think it through if there's a possible security aspect submitted to the hacker one bug Bounty program and you may be able to get a cash reward for it.
00:18:57 [W] Like it's a very simple web form.
00:19:00 [W] They've got a nice kind of guided approach that will take you through identifying the affective component identifying the class of vulnerability and walk you through identifying the severity.
00:19:14 [W] Don't worry. If you don't know specifically specific values of the correct value for some of these things both the hacker one triage team and the PLC on call will be more than happy to help you dial in the appropriate values for these what
00:19:30 [W] important is if you think there's an issue make sure it gets reported and then now to talk about the actual reward structure. I'll hand it back to read.
00:19:37 [W] Yeah, so we've the the kubernative practice security committee has kind of split things up into three different tiers of rewards.
00:19:52 [W] These are based on the severity / the CBS s the common vulnerably scoring standard.
00:19:58 [W] These are General guidelines.
00:20:03 [W] And obviously the reward of discretion is up to the cloud native Computing foundation and can be adjusted as needed depending on the individual issues.
00:20:08 [W] So for Tier 1 issues, this is considered to be core kubernetes. This includes anything.
00:20:15 [W] that's General availability a general available and beta features of core kubernetes.
00:20:25 [W] So this is both the primary kubernative a staging or any kind of kubernative Zone cordish dependencies K log would be an example and any kind of core atoms could proxy is it was a great example here if you have the ability to
00:20:34 [W] Ulster source code without owner approval or modify release artifacts that is a tier 1 issue. If you can actually dolls the the artifact themselves and you know prevent people from downloading them that's an issue and again the the
00:20:49 [W] Metrics are the the reward mounts here starts with $10,000 for critical all these are the minimums and they do have the potential to go higher.
00:21:03 [W] But at least for the minimum here is 10,000 for a tier 1 issue tier 2 includes any generally available and beta features of non core components.
00:21:13 [W] So is like CSI drivers kublr.
00:21:18 [W] 5,000 and then finally, we have tier 3 tier 3 is anything that is the kubernative infrastructure prowl documentation Etc except for again if there's any kind of
00:21:34 [W] Or again, if there's any kind of infrastructure to compromise that leads to code or odd effect modification.
00:21:39 [W] that's all under Tier 1 and then also any kind of alpha features of course kubenetes are counted here is tier 3 and tier 3 4 criticals is 2500. And so next let's have tea or talk about how to just
00:21:52 [W] So as a user or an administrator of kubenetes clusters, and if you want to be up to date on security announcements, which is a pretty good idea.
00:22:06 [W] If you're already subscribed to a general notification Channel, like kubenetes announced that is good enough.
00:22:21 [W] Although there does tend to be those are high traffic list, so you may may miss the security announcement or you may have it filtered out or or what have you so if you
00:22:26 [W] It's just for Focus security enhancements. The best place to go is kubenetes security announced at Google Groups.com.
00:22:37 [W] That will have all the announcements for security issues handled by the PSC.
00:22:42 [W] And just in general if you maybe want to do something more Beyond just doing code contributions here or want to contribute in a different way. Look out for Sig security
00:23:00 [W] Currently ongoing discussions in Sig off to that's where it's currently being discussed, but they're going to set up a new special interest group for security that will cover the Govern the non-confidential aspects of what the work that's done by the PSC kind of give it a permanent home.
00:23:16 [W] And clearly integrated with the community.
00:23:24 [W] You can join in the discussion help establish processes for the new sysdig.
00:23:46 [W] Kind of talk today about kubernative zanu bug Bounty program.
00:23:52 [W] We really hope that you take all this information and see if you can find some bugs yourself and submit them.
00:23:58 [W] Who knows you could be getting yourself some pretty high Rewards.
00:24:01 [W] Thanks.
00:24:06 [W] but everybody you have questions feel free to put them into the queue a section of the web interface and we'll be happy to answer for
00:24:21 [W] Well everybody you have questions. Feel free to put them into the queue a section of the web interface and we'll be happy to answer for
00:24:47 [W] Hi, so looks like we have one question about basically.
00:25:34 [W] if
00:25:37 [W] ever security researcher does not wish to go through hacker one can use the old security email.
00:25:44 [W] email? Yes, you can email.
00:25:45 [W] Forget the precise email but the old PSC Security report emailed or still works as to whether or not you're eligible for the Bounty. I am not sure.
00:26:02 [W] Yeah the bounty to be paid out via hacker one, so you would need to submit that via hacker one in order to be eligible for a bounty.
00:26:13 [W] But I believe it's security kubernative that I owe if I remember correctly for the email address.
00:26:16 [W] I so looks like we have one question about basically.
00:26:17 [W] if
00:26:17 [W] ever security researcher does not wish to go through hacker one can use the old security email.
00:26:18 [W] email? Yes, you can email.
00:26:18 [W] Forget the precise, you know, but the old PSC Security report emailed still works as to whether or not you're eligible for the Bounty.
00:26:22 [W] I'm not sure.
00:26:22 [W] Yeah the bounty to be paid out via hacker one, so you would need to submit that via hacker one in order to be eligible for a bounty.
00:26:24 [W] But I believe it's security kubernative that I owe if I remember correctly for the email address, but keep in mind.
00:26:25 [W] That email is really scary and not in day and encrypted so I obviously submitting over https via that when platform is is preferred.
00:26:28 [W] And then another question came in and here maybe you can take this one but it's a are the runtimes also included in the scope of the kubernative bounty containerd e creative.
00:26:50 [W] Top of my head.
00:26:54 [W] I'm not sure. Let me check and see if it is on the
00:26:59 [W] in the tear definition
00:27:03 [W] it tag innately considered separate projects outside of kubernative and that there while they're using kubernative, they are actually separate projects.
00:27:22 [W] So I'm not sure that they're included.
00:27:23 [W] Yes, so if you do have find a vulnerability in those projects, it would be good to report them.
00:27:37 [W] Especially if there's some kubernative specific aspect, but at the very least we could help out them to the right place. Are they the communities product security committee good?
00:27:45 [W] Mind that email is it really scary and not in day and encrypted so I obviously submitting over https via that when platform is is preferred.
00:27:47 [W] And then another question came in and here maybe you can take this one but it's a are the runtimes also included in the scope of the kubernative bug Bounty containerd e creative.
00:27:49 [W] Top of my head.
00:27:51 [W] I'm not sure. Let me check and see if it is on the
00:27:51 [W] in the tear definition
00:27:52 [W] Tagging idli considered separate projects outside of kubernative and the there while they're using kubernative. They are actually separate projects.
00:27:53 [W] So I'm not sure that they're included.
00:27:53 [W] Yes, so if you do have find a vulnerability in those projects, it would be good to report them.
00:27:56 [W] Especially if there's some kubernative specific aspect, but at the very least we could help out them to the right place for their communities product security pretty good.
00:27:57 [W] We have question. Are there any good examples for beginning bug Bounty program?
00:28:08 [W] Are you I'm not sure the context here. Is it saying that like good examples of in kubernative Z2 here actually went through a couple of different submissions and you can actually go to
00:28:14 [W] Kubenetes, and if you click on heck tivity, you can actually see some of the previously disclosed reports there. If you're interested in seeing like some of the previous reports that have been paid out.
00:28:30 [W] Are you are you referring to something else?
00:28:32 [W] Sorry, there's not enough context here to know if you're referring to like maybe maybe you're afraid to like getting involved in your own bug Bounty programs.
00:28:42 [W] There's plenty of other hacker one another but by programs that you're welcome to canonical.
00:28:45 [W] Tribute to or if you want to get started with doing just by Benny's in general.
00:28:54 [W] There's things like hacker 101.com which is just a great tutorial on kind of how to get going with that.
00:28:58 [W] Cool. Looks like we got a gravitation starting a bug Bounty program at a company that does not happen.
00:29:06 [W] Ah, yes.
00:29:15 [W] Yeah, so there's actually I'm trying to remember the name of it.
00:29:15 [W] So forgive me, but there's basically a bug Bounty Field Guide that hack-a-thon put out that you can look for that actually does a really good job about can I give you a start to finish process on how to get going
00:29:30 [W] And again, like I don't want to be salesy but like I can one is one option and there's other other companies as well or you can try doing stuff yourself for that. But that particular document the if you search for hacker one bug Bounty Field Guide, it's a just a freely
00:29:46 [W] You can use for getting started on building your own bug Bounty program.
00:29:50 [W] Another question came in are there more cncf projects? That aren't hacker one?
00:29:59 [W] Yes.
00:30:13 [W] I'm not sure if there's still are I know that the hyper Ledger stuff was on hacker went for a while and it sure if it still is and that there's definitely a lot of other Linux Foundation projects that are on hacker one.
00:30:14 [W] Cncf, I'm not entirely sure.
00:30:18 [W] I know that Community is by far the biggest one but I think hyper Ledger was and there may have been a couple others as well. I can take a look and see Wordly fast.
