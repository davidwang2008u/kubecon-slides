00:03:06 [W] Hi, welcome to Sig is ability session. I'm Pamela Shin Star product designer at VMware today.
00:03:16 [W] Kindly navigating the worlds of kubernative along with me is Gabby.
00:03:19 [W] I'm gonna let Gabby introduce herself.
00:03:22 [W] Thanks Pamela. My name is Gaby. I'm a designer at IBM also working on anything kubernative related.
00:03:28 [W] Well, we really appreciate you being here to start off to give you an overview of what we'll be talking about.
00:03:40 [W] We'll start off by giving an introduction to Sig has ability how it came about and what have been what are we working on and who are the people who should be contributing to this sick? We focus on time on ongoing work and what we've been doing
00:03:51 [W] To give you an overview of what we'll be talking about.
00:03:52 [W] We'll start off by giving an introduction to Sig has ability how it came about and what have been what are we working on and who are the people who should be contributing to this sig?
00:03:53 [W] We focus on time on ongoing work and what we've been doing there and how you can contribute if you want to and what the plan is for going forward.
00:03:58 [W] So sick Isabel T an introduction to it.
00:04:01 [W] It came about when a bunch of fast decided to talk around the space of user experience and kubernative.
00:04:08 [W] We wanted to focus a little bit on usability and experiences of the kubernative users and we thought why not use the open source community and platform and leverage it in terms of starting a dialogue and discussions around that.
00:04:22 [W] Today, we have a diverse set of contributors. We have product managers product designers developers all from different different fields that have been coming together to basically focus on one goal to unify the experience of kubernative and have experiences that are
00:04:38 [W] Gather to basically focus on one goal to unify the experience of kubernative and have experiences that are good enough for the community space but going forward we're going to be diving a little bit deeper kind of taking a user experience approach
00:04:46 [W] Shannan talking about the Journey of two of our contributors found the designer and Gabi the developer and this is their journey to stick his ability.
00:04:59 [W] So let's talk a little bit about family.
00:05:02 [W] Bamboo is a product designer at VMware three years ago.
00:05:04 [W] She was assigned a project that integrates kubenetes into VMware virtual platform.
00:05:12 [W] This would enable their customers to deploy kubernative workloads, which was a big big change for their platform. Wow, the pressure Pam.
00:05:16 [W] You failed at that time. She had to learn so much about kubernative use.
00:05:20 [W] So she started her research like any other designer. She went to her PM's and engineers and ask them where she could learn more about kubernative.
00:05:29 [W] She had a lot of questions.
00:05:31 [W] What is kubenetes?
00:05:33 [W] How do I design for kubernative?
00:05:34 [W] Who am I designing for our they need us to standards?
00:05:39 [W] And what about like reaching users?
00:05:40 [W] How do I get access to them?
00:05:44 [W] There were a lot of lot of cash questions.
00:05:45 [W] So she got access to a lot of and tons of like Technical Resources which help to understand kubernative and why it mattered to her company just to reference a few their the kubernetes documentation, which we all know of a ton of YouTube videos.
00:06:01 [W] The pressure panel felt at that time. She had to learn so much about kubenetes.
00:06:17 [W] So she started her research like any other designer. She went to her PM's and engineers and ask them where she could learn more about kubernative.
00:06:18 [W] She had a lot of questions.
00:06:18 [W] What is kubenetes?
00:06:18 [W] How do I design for kubernative?
00:06:18 [W] Who am I designing for our they need us to standards?
00:06:19 [W] And what about like reaching users?
00:06:20 [W] How do I get access to them? There were a lot of lot of cash questions.
00:06:21 [W] So she got access to a lot of and tons of like Technical Resources which help to understand kubernative and why it mattered to her company just to reference a few their the kubernetes documentation, which we all know of a ton of YouTube videos.
00:06:24 [W] And of course the kubernative Zu story about 50 the giraffe. Well that really helps her and they should be because there was the easiest thing to actually refer to to start with but she still had to like continue a project just like understanding the users.
00:06:31 [W] And understanding all these missing pieces that were still just so difficult to understand.
00:06:37 [W] I wish you had access to some resources that would help you understand what the others were doing in this space with any case studies about learnings and pain points and just understanding the kubernative users or just understanding the users.
00:06:39 [W] What did they want from her?
00:06:39 [W] What is this?
00:06:39 [W] What is how could she help them understand them and give them something that they wanted from their product because in the end her goal was simple just understand how users
00:06:46 [W] us and deliver experiences that were relevant to them now moving forward Gabby's going to talk about her experiences as a developer.
00:06:57 [W] Thanks Pam.
00:07:08 [W] Oh and I'll actually be channeling my inner developer here because I'm a designer but the representing house a usability fits into our code contributors for kubernative project.
00:07:13 [W] So, you know, imagine Gabby is a developer at Cloud Corp.
00:07:16 [W] And three months ago her company made the Strategic decision to contribute their next feature on their product roadmap to the kubernetes project.
00:07:31 [W] So she was assigned to work on this feature and ever since then she's been getting used to the communities communities code their tools and their processes.
00:07:35 [W] Despite the learning curve here.
00:07:42 [W] This has actually been a great experience for her.
00:07:44 [W] All these missing pieces that was still just so difficult to understand.
00:07:47 [W] I bet she had access to some resources that would help you understand what the others were doing in this space with any case studies about learnings and pain points and just understanding the communities users or just understanding the users.
00:07:49 [W] What did they want from her?
00:07:50 [W] What is this?
00:07:50 [W] What is how could she help them understand them and give them something that they wanted from their product because in the end her goal was simple just understand how users and deliver.
00:07:55 [W] Experiences that were relevant to them now moving forward Gabby's going to talk about her experiences as a developer.
00:07:57 [W] Thanks Pam.
00:08:00 [W] Oh and I'll actually be channeling my inner developer here because I'm a designer but the representing how Sig usability fits into our code contributors for kubernative project.
00:08:01 [W] So, you know, imagine Gabby is a developer at Cloud Corp and three
00:08:03 [W] Answered or her company made the Strategic decision to contribute their next feature on their product roadmap to the kubernetes project.
00:08:14 [W] So she was assigned to work on this feature and ever since then she's been getting used to the communities communities code their tools and their processes.
00:08:15 [W] Despite the learning curve here.
00:08:16 [W] This is actually been a great experience for her.
00:08:16 [W] She feels like she understands kubernative a lot better.
00:08:17 [W] Her contributions have also caught the attention of some other companies developers and they have also started contributing to the project. So that's really neat for her.
00:08:19 [W] However, as time goes by she feels pressure to wrap up and to move on with her a company's internal roadmap, you know done is better than perfect.
00:08:25 [W] But she does like to do things right and feels like her future could be even more efficient reliable not to mention usable, you know localized accessible that works.
00:08:26 [W] So just to recap kind of like house a usability fits into here, you know, as code contributors.
00:08:32 [W] We want our code contributions to be meaningful.
00:08:33 [W] We want them to be efficient reliable and usable but you know, everybody is contributors has limited time to dedicate, you know, we all have our day jobs and in particular usability
00:08:47 [W] To dedicate, you know, we all have our day jobs and in particular usability usability expertise is, you know, something that can be very specialized and say for example, you have some code contributions that
00:08:55 [W] Your list and say for example, you have some code contributions that you're working on.
00:08:58 [W] How do you get user feedback on that and in a streamlined way? So this is kind of where say usability comes in where our goals for for all of us as contributors is
00:09:11 [W] and we're seeing usability comes in where our goal is for all of us as contributors is to really look at the experience of stream kubernative and make it more consistent and user-friendly
00:09:18 [W] Experience of stream kubernative and make it more consistent and user-friendly.
00:09:20 [W] We also you know, the Sig is a great place for both designers developers researchers product managers to start, you know, building their open source foundations from
00:09:32 [W] Of Sig usability is also here to help contributors understand their users and who they are designing and contributing and developing for.
00:09:42 [W] We also want to be able to offer resources and have a unified language for usability across the kubernative project.
00:09:51 [W] So with all of that said say usability actually just turned one year in July.
00:10:00 [W] We were started in July 2019.
00:10:01 [W] And right now we have 73 members in our Google group and a hundred and twenty seven members in our slack Channel, which you all are welcome to join as far as companies actively contributing to the project. We have a pivotal Google IBM
00:10:15 [W] and red hat
00:10:17 [W] and I'm going to talk a little bit about some of our ongoing work.
00:10:26 [W] We have everything from some research projects going on to a visual design work.
00:10:32 [W] So I'll go ahead and give a an overview of that.
00:10:33 [W] Our Persona guide is one of the first projects that the Sig started working out.
00:10:46 [W] So when we got started, I think as a Sig it made a lot of sense for us to kind of come together and start talking about who uses kubernative xig who is kubernative for and I think we had a great inventory.
00:10:54 [W] the types of people that use it led by boas and their previous research at VMware and what we realize kind of after coming out of these discussions is that there's so many roles that use corinna's and
00:11:10 [W] they're coming out of these discussions is that there's so many roles that use corinna's and they can be so overlapping an example of that is the kubernative operator and then an app developer, you know, we all know that the that divide
00:11:19 [W] You know, we all know that that divide is not as clean as as we like it to be and so that kind of turned into the next project that I'll talk about here, which is our job study.
00:11:32 [W] So for for some of you that may be confirm a user research background, you know, you may have heard of a jobs to be done approach and kind of how it lets you look at what people are trying to achieve.
00:11:45 [W] With the products that they're using so cncf actually puts out a great survey every year that breaks down some demographics of the kubernative community.
00:12:00 [W] And so we can kind of see how kubernative adoption is going and what this study is trying to do is kind of an extension of that and say talk to some representative people that use kubernative and try to identify
00:12:12 [W] Opportunity use cases that we as a community can improve on and the state can do that because we are cross-cutting.
00:12:25 [W] We're not looking at any specific area of kubernative is but across the whole experience.
00:12:32 [W] So if you want to learn more about that, there's a Google doc link here in the slides and we can share that afterwards as well.
00:12:33 [W] So this takes us to our other project, which is currently led by Josie at pivotal or VMware.
00:12:49 [W] Josie is looking at at how labels are used across the kubernative project specifically usability related labels.
00:12:56 [W] So she's looking not only at kubernative but also other open source projects to see how those labels are used and hopefully, you know in in a future we can align on a set of labels.
00:13:04 [W] That we are sick usability can kind of rally around that may cover areas such as accessibility internationalization and UI not to mention UI and basically like what that can let us do is we can start socializing
00:13:20 [W] The surface usability concerns across the project. So thank you Josie for working on that. And with that I will pass it out to pommel to talk about one of the projects that she is working on.
00:13:34 [W] Thanks, Gabby.
00:13:40 [W] So icon zygons was one of the first few things that initiated the talk about having a Sig around usability user experience and there's a p.m. Of mine Tasha also a co-chair on the
00:13:53 [W] That was working with me on the project and we looked around for icons that we could find in the open source community that we could use in our products and we found that there was nothing out there that we could reference to which led to the discussion of how can we make
00:14:09 [W] More consistent across the community as there's a lot of integration and requirement of consistency in terms of visual discussion around objects and kubernative objects.
00:14:20 [W] So going forward now, we have an icon repository that we are working on.
00:14:26 [W] There's a Google doc that's linked below.
00:14:37 [W] So if you have any recommendations or would like to work with us on designing a particular icon that is in is required for you or your product do reach out to us or leave comments in the Google Doc so that we
00:14:42 [W] gather
00:14:44 [W] so looking forward that was all the work that we've been doing and is currently in the works.
00:14:58 [W] So if you have time or you would like to work with us on any of those project or have recommendations, please do reach out but we do have some projects that we want to start focusing on going forward a few of them a few ideas that you want
00:15:05 [W] Our focus on heuristics accessibility.
00:15:14 [W] How do we make kubernative more accessible and useful for everybody in the community and really focus on the developer side of the experience as Gabby was mentioning through her journey story that there is this developer
00:15:26 [W] to start supporting through the Sig make resources and make things available for them that make their life easier as when they they are doing their jobs and delivering kubernative to others so you can get involved
00:15:41 [W] Tribute and be part of a committee by a bunch of ways.
00:15:49 [W] Some of them are you can join the Sig usability slack Channel or you could follow us on GitHub and see all the discussions in the stick is ability GitHub account.
00:15:59 [W] We have a kubernative group called The kubernative Sig usability.
00:16:05 [W] This is where you can read all the past discussions get access to all the documentation that we were mentioning before. This also gives you access to the meeting invites.
00:16:12 [W] Which happen once a month on Tuesday's where we discuss any open items or anything related to usability?
00:16:27 [W] And the fourth thing is that we do want to encourage you to share your experiences on medium tag us or talk about your experiences with Sig has ability of how we can contribute more to the communities space specifically
00:16:35 [W] Is and I've linked an example here of a good.
00:16:41 [W] Medium article written by Gabby it talks about being a part of the Sig usability community and how you can contribute more.
00:16:52 [W] I would definitely check with your organization. If you can contribute there are definitely some times documents that you might have to sign to be a part of a community like this or to contribute in a community like this.
00:17:03 [W] We are always looking for ideas for discussion or areas for discussion in the usability space or how we could enhance the discussion around usability.
00:17:12 [W] It's an easy process.
00:17:15 [W] It's not very defined at the moment.
00:17:21 [W] But what we do is if you do have an idea come to one of our meetings propose an idea, we can discuss it over there have you know, you can get some feedback.
00:17:30 [W] You can also identify members that can help you with the project. We do encourage representing like an initial plan or a timeline for your project everybody's busy but it gives like a sense of just knowing where the project is going and once
00:17:43 [W] once you have your project in a good place we tend to do a final share out and document the product project so that other people have access to your findings so they can reference to it if they need going forward so
00:17:57 [W] It for today.
00:18:01 [W] Thank you for reaching coming to our session and learning about Sig is ability.
00:18:05 [W] We would love to have more contributors and people joining our team to talk usability.
00:18:15 [W] So please do reach out to Gabby and me or, you know, get involved in any of the ways that we mentioned before.
00:18:16 [W] Thank you.
00:18:17 [W] It doesn't look like we have any questions in the chat if anybody wanted drop wants to drop them in we're happy to take them and if not we can end early.
00:18:41 [W] Call it a session and Pummel and I can go ahead and share some of like the links that we mentioned in our presentation on the slack slack being a to kubeacademy in teener after this talk.
00:19:41 [W] So, thank you all for coming.
00:19:42 [W] Thank you.
