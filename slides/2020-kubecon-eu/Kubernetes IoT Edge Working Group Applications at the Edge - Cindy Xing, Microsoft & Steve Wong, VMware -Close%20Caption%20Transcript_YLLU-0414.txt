00:00:02 [W] Hi, this is Sharon is presented by the kubernative.
00:00:07 [W] He's iot Edge working group.
00:00:09 [W] This is about using kubernative.
00:00:11 [W] He's for Edge applications.
00:00:14 [W] I'm Steve Wang a tech lead of the working group.
00:00:15 [W] I work on kubernative that a few other open source projects as an employee of VMware today. I'm joined by Cindy.
00:00:22 [W] Hello, this is Cindy sing.
00:00:27 [W] I'm co-chair of this kubernative iot Edge working group.
00:00:34 [W] Currently, I work at Microsoft as a principal software engineering manager.
00:00:36 [W] Especially I'm working on a short iot Edge.
00:00:38 [W] So we can move to the agenda.
00:00:44 [W] So before we talk about the edge applications, let's first address what address about then.
00:00:56 [W] We're going to explain in detail about Edge applications characteristics operational consideration and toolings.
00:01:06 [W] And after that Steve will drill down to serverless at at the edge in detail in the end will share contact.
00:01:09 [W] Mission and the Nick to this deck. I hope you will like the talk.
00:01:14 [W] So what is Edge Computing what's special about it?
00:01:26 [W] Ouch Computing means compute close to where data is originally generated.
00:01:33 [W] It has high security requirements data locality and compliance need to be maintained the scale of edge devices can be in the range of thousands millions or tens of Millions.
00:01:47 [W] There are tons of data and some of them is real-time Edge Computing is very Diversified and heater.
00:01:57 [W] Oh genius Hardware operating system and on the line infrastructure can be quite different.
00:02:04 [W] Local resources can be in form of Raspberry Pi server machine or cluster of machines from use case perspective.
00:02:17 [W] It can be Telco 5G industrial iot retail connected cars and Etc.
00:02:23 [W] Edge needs to coordinate with color Claude and it also requires local autonomy. Ideally zero touch operation with observability and Remote Management
00:02:38 [W] heard
00:02:41 [W] Now let's talk about Edge applications characteristics and requirements.
00:02:48 [W] When comparing Edge applications with Cloud ones they have similar Nature's for example, however, liability reliability scalability performance and Etc from
00:03:04 [W] The greatest perspective the requirements for eligibility questions are much higher. Imagine.
00:03:13 [W] We're running workloads remote and locations while wouldn't want to encrypt data before storing it to the disk.
00:03:21 [W] Some privacy secrets are better to be held at Hardware level and each application should a test itself at runtime.
00:03:32 [W] Given Edge devices can be resource constraint together with the needs of cost-saving edge applications need to be lightweight and control the in resource consumption.
00:03:47 [W] Some Edge applications like video streaming gaming or machine learning.
00:03:58 [W] They need to process real-time data with high performance requirement.
00:04:04 [W] The amount of data processed will be huge and some of the data has to be local not leaving the device.
00:04:09 [W] well as devices and applications talking to each other identity provisioning and credential management need to be enabled Edge applications are highly distributed and they run
00:04:25 [W] under complicated Network topology
00:04:28 [W] Here, let's take a deeper.
00:04:32 [W] Look a Raspberry Pi 3 has one gigabyte memory and the Intel server has 4 gigabyte.
00:04:41 [W] Each application can be written in C rusts C++ dotnet: note the doj's Java a lot of languages operating system can be
00:04:57 [W] Centos or Windows or Android underlying infrastructure can be bi-metal virtual machine k3s macro k8s Q badge or
00:05:12 [W] kubernative cluster
00:05:14 [W] they sound different use cases and scenarios one will have to pick and choose.
00:05:21 [W] Now, let's see the operational consideration running a kubernative cluster at the edge will have a lot of challenges.
00:05:38 [W] For example, we need to evaluate what kind of app model to be used in the industry.
00:05:46 [W] There are darker kubernative how and open and location model.
00:05:51 [W] Each provides apis and the command line tools darker is straightforward though. It has limited capabilities.
00:06:02 [W] Currently there's is very powerful, but the complicated.
00:06:08 [W] How charge allows customers to describe the workflow of complicated application deployment?
00:06:17 [W] Ohm was targeted to separate application components and operational configuration and make the deployment easier.
00:06:28 [W] No, how about application itself?
00:06:35 [W] how will or cloudbees operated it can run as virtuous VM Carter containerd darker knative process or webassembly sembly some
00:06:48 [W] Legacy applications cannot be continued rised are really hard to be containerized the operating system may not support container in that case.
00:07:03 [W] You might have to use post process some workloads needs to enable higher level security isolation in that case. You probably want to use virtual machine or Cutter container.
00:07:14 [W] Webassembly is a new way for process isolation.
00:07:24 [W] It has drawn a lot of attention in the industry. Next. Let's say where to store those applications. How about application packaging story?
00:07:33 [W] how to access the application Repository
00:07:38 [W] The application repository can be continued registry.
00:07:43 [W] The registry need to be deployed and then from Edge node perspective in needs to access this container registry.
00:07:57 [W] So how to access and where to store the access credentials if the network bandwidth between Edge and Claude is limited.
00:08:06 [W] Do we need to deploy our local containerd registry as a mirror?
00:08:08 [W] From packaging perspective. Is it in form of Darker image powerful Hasina bundle?
00:08:18 [W] applications are distributed then we also need to think about different programming model to enable this highlight distributed nature reactive
00:08:38 [W] Don't like a Java spring is widely used in the Java Community recently Google and Microsoft announced k- and Dapper to allow developers run after
00:08:53 [W] Operate event-driven actor model in distributed fashion at Edge.
00:08:59 [W] Especially for diaper enables applications to achieve Network routing statement management and some other capabilities. The model is through a site car.
00:09:14 [W] Digital tween is a modeling language.
00:09:18 [W] It allows the developer to digitalize the connected things.
00:09:25 [W] So all those can be leveraged but you need to think about which one to use
00:09:29 [W] Add applications they run remote to achieve Remote Management and observability Matrix logging tracing collections are needed.
00:09:45 [W] applications also need to be versioned and updated
00:09:51 [W] When application is in form of container one can verify from Claude our desktop and deploy to Edge without worrying.
00:10:25 [W] However, in case a remote access and debugger will be helpful.
00:10:25 [W] At Edge Look host level. They are operating system from where driver containerd runtime.
00:10:26 [W] Those are host level processes.
00:10:26 [W] They need to update it.
00:10:27 [W] So then the question is what will be the mechanism.
00:10:27 [W] Obvious to author host Butte and verifiable occations.
00:10:39 [W] They are tools needed GitHub and get a widely adopted for Source control and parallel programming for code editor and debugger.
00:10:52 [W] They are various code IntelliJ Eclipse goal and Etc. Personally. I found the Golan is pretty helpful if you need to code in go.
00:11:01 [W] And Jenkins normally is used or widely adopted for ci/cd.
00:11:08 [W] Now I'm going to switch back to Steve to cover serverless and Edge Steve. Thank you Cindy. It's in he pointed out apps that edge can be in various languages and forms next. I'm going to talk about
00:11:24 [W] It has become popular in the public Cloud. So I'm going to talk about serverless and whether this makes sense at the edge.
00:11:31 [W] So what is serverless?
00:11:38 [W] Well the term started out with the announcement of AWS Lambda in a 2014 reinvent keynote by Werner vogel's there's been steady growth in interest as you can see in this chart
00:11:48 [W] The term serverless group through a lot of ridicule at first because obviously there are still servers and what I'm going to talk about isn't just about the original Lambda.
00:12:04 [W] It was the first but now all the major clouds have something similar things like Cloud functions on Google Cloud function compute on Alibaba as your functions and others.
00:12:16 [W] There's some healthy open source projects like K native open fast and others
00:12:18 [W] There and they're designed to support functions as a service that you would run on your own the cncf hosts a serverless working group.
00:12:31 [W] So let's analyze what this serverless concept is really about.
00:12:33 [W] This is the Lambda definition from the docks.
00:12:43 [W] Let's analyze how it might apply if Lambda was hosted at Edge a key difference that edge is that you likely own and operate the host infrastructure.
00:12:55 [W] There may be some Telco use cases that talk about hosting multi-tenant workloads in cell towers, but for the most part I'm equating edge with on-premises servers.
00:13:05 [W] And by the user I added some red colouring here to what's in the AWS docs to highlight some items.
00:13:17 [W] Bottom this statement No, Charge would not running makes sense in a public Cloud as a business model decision via by the vendor, but run that same thing on an on-premises
00:13:32 [W] Most that's yours in this no charge aspect goes away you pay for it that without provisioning and managing statement is similar whether it's an employee or you choose to Outsource.
00:13:47 [W] you're paying for that provisioning and management. And if you have resource constraints, the scales automatically part in red here might not apply to you either.
00:13:59 [W] So are we done here serverless at Edge doesn't
00:14:02 [W] Make sense.
00:14:07 [W] Not quite because well that label serverless got slapped on lambdas.
00:14:09 [W] lambdas. There's a little more to it.
00:14:10 [W] Moving deeper inside the Lambda docs, you'll find some additional aspects some that are super valuable in Edge applications. When you use Lambda, you invoke code automatically in response to events. You can build up
00:14:26 [W] Systems by wiring cascading stages of Advent consumption and generation.
00:14:34 [W] This is really a tool kit that would enable you to build an event-driven architecture and to be fair.
00:14:46 [W] I went back and watched Werner vogel's talk and it actually LED with the value proposition of event-driven computing serverless elimination came up later.
00:14:51 [W] So in a simple form an event-driven architecture looks like this and event is a piece of information often used to communicate facts like measurements or commands statements of intent functions and
00:15:11 [W] Services consumed events and it's up to these applications to decide what to do with each event events can be ignored forwarded stored or transformed in a Time series stream of events weather events are measurements or commands.
00:15:26 [W] A new one might make an older one year relevant. If A build-up occurs in a queue analysis of events might have in amid new events based on a transformation.
00:15:39 [W] In a distributed system and event screen is a communication Fabric and when absent event flows are viewed together, this is actually a programming model event-driven architecture can be helpful because it encourages some
00:15:55 [W] Development practices I'm talking about loose coupling independently maintainable components and separation of concerns a distribution layer here can help organize things and maybe even offload things you might otherwise have to write
00:16:11 [W] Self in the application or application components an example of this would be a pubsub broker eliminating maintenance of a distribution list from the duties of an event publisher.
00:16:25 [W] So serverless in a public cloud is really about the producers pricing model not physical reality from a building perspective. Your service provider makes the server sort of Invisible by not charging you for the instance
00:16:44 [W] Let's examine this further.
00:16:49 [W] Let's have a pretend show of hands here now.
00:16:50 [W] Come on. I know it's a virtual conference, but just do it.
00:16:57 [W] You've been sitting in that chair too long and you need a stretch break.
00:17:04 [W] So I'm going to ask you a question. How many of you have gone home on the weekend and have that moment. Where you go? Oh crap.
00:17:12 [W] Did I leave my ec2 to Phillip man instance running, you know there there are scenarios were not paying for that server instance is a
00:17:16 [W] attractive when you run in public Cloud, so it's great for public Cloud. But doing this at Edge isn't really serverless at all still.
00:17:26 [W] Let's not throw out the concept because of a bad label and Edge you have a distributed system and these are really hard to develop troubleshoot and get to work right event-driven Computing is a really useful
00:17:38 [W] Modern that edge and we need every useful tool we can get our hands on. So let's just throw away that serverless label, but we as developers know that the press the marketing people and some of our bosses like it
00:17:53 [W] They like a one liner description of value and I've got one for him for for them.
00:18:00 [W] Jeremy will bear with me here.
00:18:07 [W] I'm going to do a stream of Consciousness thing that will come together at the end.
00:18:09 [W] Let's go back in time.
00:18:13 [W] We begin in the 60s at that picture on the top left.
00:18:15 [W] The IBM Mainframe was King large organizations could afford one of these installed at headquarters in a showcase purpose-built Rome data originated from distant people traveled by paper
00:18:28 [W] Keypunch operators onto carts.
00:18:34 [W] most people never came close to that computer. Maybe they were allowed to stare at it through a glass window if they were located in the headquarters the 70s saw a lower-priced minikube Pewters installed in many dispersed locations.
00:18:47 [W] Patience. Most people still never came close enough to touch one, but more did them before the personal computer revolution of started in the 80s and eventually most offices and even some wealthy households
00:19:01 [W] One in shared it eventually it got even cheaper and became something close to a one per person scenario.
00:19:16 [W] The trend has been that the computer has been getting closer and closer to the people producing and ingesting the information the cell phone took it a step further with devices literally at people's hands 24 by 7.
00:19:23 [W] I submit that the next stage is that compute is now going to go ahead of the people. It can't get any closer. So the next
00:19:32 [W] up is to go ahead apps like machine learning medical image processing our landing at points in the data stream ahead of people to reduce latency and take on tasks. People didn't like or couldn't do very well.
00:19:46 [W] All I propose that event driven at Edge is a great concept, but let's relabel it from serverless to peopleís.
00:19:58 [W] This is about eliminating people in boring jobs, like watching analog security camera monitors and putting the compute up front.
00:20:05 [W] There are some challenges here. Some Frameworks are resource intensive for running on the smallest Edge Hardware Kata of them talking about you open fast is perhaps a little bit better, but that doesn't mean don't use these
00:20:22 [W] siddur Landing framework like a native at the Gateway tear and using something similar to pipe data flows originating on the smaller devices mqtt as an example the
00:20:38 [W] Latency might be an issue.
00:20:41 [W] So perhaps configure your system to never go to zero instances after all as I pointed out earlier. You're probably paying for the host 24 by 7 anyway,
00:20:51 [W] State is a big issue, you know lambdas in AWS are stateless.
00:20:58 [W] But useful apps typically need to have some retain States somewhere Edge is an exception to this rule.
00:21:13 [W] I'll throw out a few thoughts here, you know update in place is dangerous whether we're talking about device firmware or data consider spending the money to keep at least two copies or full
00:21:21 [W] Example of the danger here is breaking a device when power is interrupted mid update in a 30-minute session.
00:21:30 [W] We just can't cover everything.
00:21:41 [W] So if you find content like this useful Cindy and I want to invite you to become members of The kubernative iot Edge working group.
00:21:46 [W] We aren't writing code in kubernative in this group, but we are focused on applying kubernative with additional open source tools to Edge and iot use k8s.
00:21:51 [W] Cases, we've got online meetings every two weeks at alternating times to accommodate members in different time zones.
00:21:59 [W] I've shown here.
00:22:02 [W] We encourage a member-driven agenda and we operator also operating a group channel on the kubernative slack.
00:22:11 [W] Thank you for attending this session Cindy and I are going to stick around for a few minutes to handle questions if you have any but if you're watching this recording later, you can also reach out to us on the kubernative edge iot slack Channel.
00:22:28 [W] Yeah, again, welcome to join our group.
00:22:34 [W] We are meeting regularly.
00:22:36 [W] Feel free to reach out to us.
00:22:39 [W] Thank you for joining us for this session.
00:22:42 [W] And with that said we're finished.
00:22:45 [W] I'll turn it back over to the cncf organizers.
00:22:46 [W] So hopefully you can hear me.
00:23:12 [W] I'm here for Q&A. If anybody's got any questions this session was pre-recorded. So I'd like to add a little commentary to the presentation. I did on using the cane
00:23:23 [W] And it's describing it as potentially resource intensive. So if you use K native with this deal, which is form it's often used with it is pretty resource demanding.
00:23:39 [W] However, I've recently discovered, you know, if this is a fast moving field and I've discovered that there is an ability and K native to swap out the servicemeshcon layer for things like Courier or Contour.
00:23:52 [W] To get it to have a lower appetite for Ram and CPU cores.
00:24:08 [W] So this would be something that I like to present on at a future meeting of the iot edge working group. So, you know the warning with all things that move rapidly and certainly kubernative zat edges one of these is that things change.
00:24:13 [W] inch and any presentation or blog post needs to have a sell-by date, so I'm warning you that this one that you just saw is already potentially starting to have room for
00:24:28 [W] Provement but come and join the group and learn more as things progress.
00:24:34 [W] Cindy did you have any other remarks that you wanted to add?
00:24:39 [W] And right now there is also on the cncf slack a channel that will be monitoring for questions.
00:25:07 [W] It's under to - Cube Khan - maintainer and I think that will be patrolled for the duration of this session and maybe a few minutes after that after that go to the kubernative slack
00:25:20 [W] And the iot edge working group has a perpetually ongoing slack Channel there.
00:25:27 [W] Swati I saw your comment in the queue a chat window.
00:28:59 [W] Thanks for the compliment to others just a heads up on what's currently on the agenda for the next meeting.
00:29:09 [W] We're going to have a presentation on the cranial project and
00:29:14 [W] Like I said earlier, I'm expecting to have an update on the concept of serverless at Edge.
00:29:21 [W] Okay, everyone. Thanks for coming.
00:30:02 [W] I'm going to turn it back over to the cncf organizers.
