00:01:50 [W] Hi, my name is sidhu is Allah.
00:08:17 [W] I am a open source developer at IBM and I contribute to Cuban eighties.
00:08:25 [W] I am a co-chair of this project called provider IBM Cloud, which is a sub-project of The kubernative cloudbees Wider sub special interest group, and I'm also one of the maintainer for the HD project.
00:08:34 [W] Would you like to introduce yourself, please?
00:08:43 [W] I'm cold. I'm wet and I'm also a colleague on the provider for the IBM cloud and I also work on IBM's kubernative.
00:08:50 [W] kubernative. He's and multi-cloud management offerings and in the open source community and ecosystem projects related to it.
00:08:57 [W] Thank you, Connie.
00:09:02 [W] Welcome to this video.
00:09:06 [W] We have a few items on the agenda will provide an overview of the Sig cloud provider followed by you know, this project for IBM clouds will go to the structure activities and then we'll talk about
00:09:17 [W] Plus 3 Pi provider IBM Cloud, which is a GitHub repository owned by this project.
00:09:30 [W] I'll talk about the IBM cloud provider and what's have you know, what road map we have for the future there and then we'll talk about the hybrid Cloud ecosystem around IBM cloud.
00:09:37 [W] All right. So the cloud provider special interest group is one of the signal kubenetes and it does lot of things actually it owns the code around Cloud for interface and I know all the related work
00:09:53 [W] already know there are specific control groups that comes you know with communities to enable Cuban is functionality is for you know, when you deploy any particular cloud and
00:10:09 [W] Lose control loops includes many different things different interfaces to enable the load balancer, you know for the nodes to find out the IP is zoning information.
00:10:23 [W] multiple interfaces, but the cloud for
00:10:26 [W] what?
00:10:32 [W] But that repository that has the code for this Cloud Loops interface.
00:10:40 [W] It's owned by cloud provider.
00:10:42 [W] There is a URL here.
00:10:43 [W] You can learn more there the SQL zones all the sub projects.
00:10:52 [W] They were formerly owned by individual cloud provider sings like see AWS, or see kazoo or see this EP Sig IBM cloud and and similar way seek openstack see cream where but the consolidation
00:11:01 [W] In now, all of them are, you know become a sub-project of the Sig Cloud providers.
00:11:11 [W] So the Sig, you know, IBM cloud is now called a provider IBM cloud and it's a sub-project of the club for the special interest group The SQL so ensures that the Cubans ecosystem is dueling in neutral to
00:11:23 [W] so it makes sure there is no favor for one cloud provider or other provider and it also makes sure there is a consistent high quality user experience across different providers in a part of the Sig policy
00:11:39 [W] having chairs for the cgroup
00:11:54 [W] All right. So programming Cloud sub-project.
00:12:04 [W] The sub-project is basically around building deploying maintaining supporting and using Cuban. He's on IBM cloud.
00:12:12 [W] We have IBM Cloud Community Service as a minister. He's also have a red hat openshift as a managed service and as you can expect, you know, if you are participating in this
00:12:23 [W] I mean Cloud sub-project.
00:12:24 [W] The sub-project is basically around the building deploying maintaining supporting and using kubernative.
00:12:25 [W] Zon IBM cloud.
00:12:25 [W] We have IBM Cloud Community stories as a minister. He's also have a red hat openshift as a managed service and as you can expect, you know, if you are participating in this
00:12:26 [W] If you're a member of the mailing list are you know, you basically interact with many developers and leaders from IBM cloud and and you know have this discussions around kubenetes around some of the other cncf.
00:12:39 [W] X in open platform
00:12:43 [W] so you can follow the relations happening around the IBM Cloud platforms regards to Cuba and he's and other scenes in projects.
00:12:52 [W] do not use this platform or this platform is not for any commercial discussions around any products.
00:13:00 [W] There are three colleagues call it element the who is IBM distinguished engineer and one of the co-speaker here represents multi-cloud manager and leads work there or in short is who is an expert
00:13:17 [W] Rocks and myself from the open source side for interested, please join the mailing list, you know to keep up to date with what's going on with this project.
00:13:33 [W] There is a provider - IBM Cloud slack channel on the Cuban is slack side and you can learn more about the project at the provided URL.
00:13:43 [W] as for the activities are concerned, you know Sig mates every month with slack Channels with emails making least, you know, we don't see a need to meet every week kind of things which we used to
00:13:59 [W] You have in the past but now the cygnets every month last Wednesday at 2 p.m. Eastern time if you're in different time zone if you get you know, if you could not attend those meetings.
00:14:22 [W] Which is part of the border. So the obviously we participate in this exact tivities there as far as you know, option contributions are concerned. We have a GitHub repositories called cluster API for IBM cloud
00:14:47 [W] So, you know the pride IBM Cloud so project which is part of the see Cloud folders. So the you know, obviously we participate in this exact ivities there as far as you know, option contributions are concerned. We have a
00:14:49 [W] You may already know about the cluster API project.
00:14:51 [W] It's a Cuban is project and the IBM Cloud API provider.
00:15:01 [W] It's basically an implementation of this project and it provides, you know, optional functionalities on top of the code Cuban. It is around managing the lifecycle of Cubans cluster.
00:15:11 [W] Call it will talk more on that and then we are working on support for out of free IBM cloud provider.
00:15:21 [W] I'll be talking about that right after I'm talk.
00:15:26 [W] The manager of things we have so I guess IBM cloud kubenetes service is one of manage offering to create humans cluster. So I guess Implement zebrium cloud provider to provide the functionality is when you
00:15:43 [W] Kubenetes cluster using IKS and as you may know there is a come from its program in kubenetes. So, you know this the IKS is a certified human is offering.
00:15:58 [W] Are you can read more about Ikea's on this URL provided right here in this slide?
00:16:06 [W] Rocks Red Hat openshift Primal clouds is another manage offering openshift as you may know already know.
00:16:18 [W] It's a product that is build on top of kubenetes and provides many additional features.
00:16:25 [W] there. It is. Also a certified Cuban. It is offering and you can learn more about Open shape on the ibm.com.
00:16:32 [W] All right.
00:16:35 [W] So the IBM cloud provider there there has been some discussions going on.
00:16:47 [W] So if you're following the discussion discussions in the community around cloud provider cgroup.
00:17:02 [W] CM but the community realized that you know, that's that's that that is something needs to decouple from the core communities so that the Cuban it is and cloud provider can evolve independently,
00:17:17 [W] You know the process still going on some of the providers are already moved the code outside it call out of three codes versus entry but IBM cloud provider.
00:17:33 [W] We already have support for CCM.
00:17:38 [W] That's what we use now.
00:17:39 [W] And you know as I mentioned already, right there are multiple interfaces that cloud product can Implement not necessary. They have to implement all of them.
00:17:53 [W] Some of the beaker interface is rather more than this but our load balancer instances zones clusters and droughts.
00:18:09 [W] We implement the first three one load balancer.
00:18:15 [W] We are two offerings for the classic Cloud infrastructure or the NLB version 1.0 IP table based and the 2.0 which is ipbs based.
00:18:24 [W] Instances why is instances we to is it's a new new interface with which will be working hard to implement and and and you know, we implement the zones clusters and droughts.
00:18:39 [W] We have no need to implement them right now for the routes. We use what Calico provides for the future, you know, as I mentioned there was you know in the
00:18:55 [W] These early versions the code that enables the cloud provider functionality is the control loops are part of the core capabilities.
00:19:11 [W] So at one point the committee decided to stop at taking any new code there from any no new cloud provider and that's where you know, we started exporting it so we don't have coat there what we have is it's based on CCM. So
00:19:19 [W] We started exporting it so we don't have coat there.
00:19:22 [W] What we have is it's based on CCM. So they are pretty much ready for the out of three out of three limitation. So
00:19:28 [W] We will be open sourcing it as we following what's going on there. And you know, we'll be working on that. But on that line along with that, we work on improving the documentation and you align the bills.
00:19:45 [W] Our tastes and releases process with the community there are discussions going on about making it more consistent across different Cloud providers. So we will try to align with that as well.
00:19:59 [W] But with that calida will hand it over to you sir.
00:20:07 [W] Thank you.
00:20:08 [W] Thank you set up.
00:20:09 [W] So I'll talk about a few projects that were working on in the areas of hybrid cloud and by hybrid. We mean not only the ability to run on premise as well as various public clouds, but also hybrid in the sense that
00:20:23 [W] Applications and workloads are although the cloud native workloads run in kubernative. Use there are other work.
00:20:33 [W] A modern management plane things like traditional VM workloads as well.
00:20:43 [W] So we're trying to bring some of those things together into a common management model based on kubernative.
00:20:56 [W] So one of the projects that is coming out in open source is around this multi cluster management for kubernative, and this is a project or partnering with
00:21:03 [W] that on and red hat actually took some of the original code that was developed in IBM and is in the process of making that available as an open source project and
00:21:19 [W] Leave their if you look at this URL a version of that allows you to deploy out and manage multiple kubernative.
00:21:30 [W] He's clusters with a focus on the life cycle management of openshift environments and being able to control and operate them a Deployable workloads on them have
00:21:44 [W] to search across kubernative clusters for resources and also to handle some of the governance and risk aspects of the configuration of kubernative environments to make sure
00:22:00 [W] With the governance and risk aspects of the configuration of kubernative environments to make sure by your standards.
00:22:06 [W] So this is available. If the product for that is called the red hat advanced class penchant for kubernative and you can go and download and
00:22:17 [W] a product for that is called the red hat advanced class penchant for kubernative and you can go and download and turn downs, but in your environment and it gives a base management
00:22:22 [W] Playing for kubernative use to deploy out and manage multiple kubernative environment.
00:22:30 [W] So if we can go to the next slide one aspect of that is the policy management and this is where both red hat and IBM are encouraging an ecosystem contributions
00:22:42 [W] Around how to manage and develop policies in a open but kubernative knative models.
00:22:56 [W] I won't go through into all the details of the architecture and so on but it is kubernative.
00:23:03 [W] He's based there's a you know, llamo file that defines what the custom resource that defines your policy that can be checked into GitHub and there's a way of deploying out policies from a central management Hub to a set of
00:23:11 [W] he's managed clusters and getting the reports of those policies in terms of the violation and so on that occurred back into the central management Hub and the types of policies,
00:23:27 [W] You can integrate with Opa there's work. That's also being looked at to integrate with other Opa related ecosystem projects like gatekeeper and so on but it is intended to be an open framework.
00:23:42 [W] Um that allows different controllers to be defined and distribute out the policies to different locations and white based on labels or controls and gather the results.
00:23:56 [W] Okay.
00:24:07 [W] So this is a policy management extension that we're looking for people to participate in and drive some some Community around so that's the multi cluster management.
00:24:12 [W] Around kubernative. So if we switch to the next slide
00:24:16 [W] I want to talk about another related project. This is about manage IQ.
00:24:25 [W] Again.
00:24:28 [W] This is a totally open source project. The history of that was that it was based on an acquisition that red hat made and and it led to a product
00:24:41 [W] Have called Cloud forms, but as part of the acquisition and relationship with red hat.
00:24:54 [W] This manage IQ project is being kind of handled by IBM now and it is part of an offering from from IBM.
00:25:02 [W] IBM. I'll talk a bit about that later. Right but one of the new things about this project. So what manage IQ does is allows you to manage to
00:25:12 [W] additional virtual environment so things like VMware or KVM based Solutions kubernative and red hat and so on manage containerd knative virtualization this allows you to
00:25:27 [W] little workloads with traditional virtualization
00:25:31 [W] Into a kubernative based management model the traditional manager IQ deployment was on BMS. The latest iteration of that is a pot of fide version of manager IQ.
00:25:47 [W] where the manage IQ control plane itself can run on kubernative.
00:25:58 [W] he's and we you know made managed IQ into a set of microservices that can be deployed within a kubernative environment.
00:26:01 [W] And it supports a variety of providers that I mentioned right allows you to connect to a variety of cloud providers as well as on-premise VMware traditional virtualization. It manages the infrastructure the networking and
00:26:17 [W] Variety of cloud providers as well as odd premise VMware traditional virtualization it manages the infrastructure the networking and storage and brings that together.
00:26:20 [W] Okay. So this is another ecosystem project that helps, you know, the hybrid management aspect of the things so the open cluster management deals with kubernetes and openshift the
00:26:33 [W] Open shaft the the this project deals with traditional VM based workloads in is workloads within within your Cloud environment the next chart.
00:26:46 [W] So Assad evoluted to the cluster API project and this is about the life cycle management of individual clusters.
00:26:57 [W] And this is IBM contributes to that. We have a vibe.
00:27:00 [W] GM Cloud plug-in that allows you to declare how you want a cluster to be provisioned and from a bootstrap node. You can provision multiple clusters
00:27:15 [W] it interacts with the infrastructure providers to provision the appropriate infrastructure resources and match and connect the all the kubernative control plane elements the
00:27:31 [W] Oscar's the at CDC and the worker nodes and proxy Etc and allows you to you know, do things like scaling up and scaling down number of worker loads and so on and there's so this is
00:27:45 [W] Lots of generic project. We implemented a provider implementation that is specific to the IBM Cloud for this. Okay.
00:27:55 [W] Next chart so hybrid applications are are about workloads.
00:28:05 [W] So there's a GitHub project called hybrid app I owe and there's a link to the documentation and what this project does is to extend the notion of applications.
00:28:18 [W] It's based on the Sig app model that is in the kubernetes ecosystem, but it extends it to
00:28:25 [W] Able to manage multi-component applications that span both kubernative resources as well as traditional VM resources and in the future looking at, you know other types of
00:28:41 [W] Cloud infrastructure, so if you want a application that has a managed database service that you want to leverage from the cloud or part of an application where you want to leverage a function of the
00:28:56 [W] The type of function then you can integrate that.
00:29:03 [W] This is another area where we would like contributions from the open community and helping and driving the incubation of this project so that we can integrate with other types of
00:29:17 [W] Deployer deployment models, so things like ansible or cosplayers and other clouds and so on currently it provides a bridge between both containerd workloads and traditional VM workloads and we'll be looking at
00:29:32 [W] Extending the overall application model to cover day two operations of an application things like monitoring and Dr. And backup and event management Etc.
00:29:47 [W] OK and let's switch to the next chart and this is from a product perspective or an offering perspective.
00:29:56 [W] This is what we bring together a number of the open source projects the hybrid app the open cluster.
00:30:03 [W] Management or the red hat Advanced cluster management as well as manage IQ to give a Open Standards based management plane for hybrid applications, right?
00:30:17 [W] It's built on kubernative eyes. It's you know, trying to avoid any lock in it's built around a number of Open Source components and it enables an ecosystem because it is based on kubernative and
00:30:31 [W] Standard in the community, it allows other partners and other projects to plug in and the areas of operational automation application management security and governance and visibility and so
00:30:46 [W] Okay, I won't go through all the other components that make up that this product but Leverage is a lot and contributes to a lot of those ecosystem projects with that you see in there.
00:31:01 [W] Okay.
00:31:03 [W] So let me talk about a couple of other projects that are specific to kubernative now.
00:31:09 [W] We can switch to the next chart.
00:31:10 [W] Right. We did make some contributions and thus on get Hub around more advanced scheduling capabilities.
00:31:24 [W] So this is a project that tries to marry a i with schedule and capabilities. It uses a learning-based algorithm reinforcement learning algorithm to
00:31:36 [W] Allow you to detect certain problems that are kind of hard to do. If you do a traditional algorithmic model things like pods always failing on a certain node.
00:31:51 [W] They can be that can happen for a number of reasons.
00:31:56 [W] For example, the PVC is not bound the NASA access on a node has been revoked and the device plug ins for gpus and not
00:32:05 [W] figured probably you can also have situations where a placing a pot on a node will lead to poor performance and there could be a variety of reasons that are listed there whether CPU
00:32:21 [W] Terror clock speed and so on.
00:32:27 [W] So rather than trying to come up with an algorithm that is very tied to those conditions.
00:32:35 [W] What we did is a scheduler extender that uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to adaptively learn where a particular type of workloads.
00:32:44 [W] Dead as a scheduler extender that uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to adaptively learn where a particular type of workload is best placed
00:32:48 [W] Is best placed based on the variety of conditions and based on learning from different failure modes and different cases of bad performance and so on so the scheduler extender basically extends the kubernative scheduler.
00:33:01 [W] Learning from different failure modes of different cases of bad performance and so on. So the scheduler extender basically extends the kubernative scheduler to take into account the results of the AI
00:33:05 [W] Take into account the results of the AI algorithm to direct the workloads to a particular node that best fits dot dot set of conditions that might cause problems.
00:33:17 [W] In terms of that.
00:33:22 [W] So it looks at the performance aspects looks at the availability aspects and it tries to learn the behavior of workloads to be optimally placed.
00:33:32 [W] Okay. So this is a incubation project again, we're looking for feedback on on that next chart.
00:33:41 [W] So this last project again the GitHub location is there it's again around.
00:33:47 [W] Scheduling but about multi cluster.
00:33:51 [W] how to dispatch workloads from a central location to multiple kubernative clusters and this addresses some of the challenges that people have especially around managing batch type of
00:34:05 [W] It's workloads.
00:34:12 [W] So there's a notion of a a proper witch can wrap a a variety of kubernative resources that gets scheduled or placed into this dispatcher running in a dispatcher cluster and
00:34:22 [W] They can be deployed out to different execution postures. So different jobs or different deployments and kubernative resources can be placed for are scheduled on
00:34:38 [W] and this prize to address some of the gaps if one cluster is very busy because of bursty workloads coming and going this looks at, you know available capacities for clusters as well as energy awareness of the the
00:34:54 [W] Energy consumption and so on and tries to make a intelligent decision about where to run these workloads. Okay. So that's it from my side.
00:35:10 [W] I think that that's the overall talk. I don't know if there's any other charts but
00:35:12 [W] any closing comments set up, so
00:35:17 [W] All right.
00:35:19 [W] Well, thank you.
00:35:23 [W] The closing comment is thank you Khalid.
00:35:25 [W] Thank you everyone for watching this video.
00:35:27 [W] Shout through slack Channel Through mailing list, you know various ways. If you any question about this presentation about the project and you know, we would like to have your participations in the City Club folder in the point IBM Cloud project. So
00:35:44 [W] Look forward to work with you.
00:35:46 [W] And with that Khalid.
00:35:50 [W] Thanks again.
00:35:50 [W] Thanks everyone.
00:35:52 [W] Thank you. Thank you.
00:35:54 [W] Feel free to anybody in the audience to ask questions and the Box the Q&A box.
00:37:12 [W] They're not thinking here.
00:37:20 [W] No, I can cut it. So yeah, it should be never issued able to get it yet.
00:37:31 [W] One is seems like there are no questions.
00:38:15 [W] So I guess we can wrap it up Kali the anyone any questions later. Please reach out to us.
00:38:17 [W] We'll be glad to work with you.
00:38:21 [W] Okay? Good.
00:38:23 [W] Thank you.
