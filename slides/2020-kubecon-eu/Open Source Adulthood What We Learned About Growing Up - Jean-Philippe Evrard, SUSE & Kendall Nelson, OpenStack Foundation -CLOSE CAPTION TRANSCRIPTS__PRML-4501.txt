00:01:22 [W] Hello, everybody.
00:06:01 [W] Welcome to our talk today.
00:06:05 [W] We really appreciate you taking the time to listen to what we have to say about open source development.
00:06:11 [W] Our talk today is called open source adulthood of what we learned to growing up.
00:06:17 [W] I am Kendall Nelson.
00:06:20 [W] I work for the openstack foundation and I've been actually actively involved in the openstack community since 2015.
00:06:28 [W] before I started at the foundation I was involved.
00:06:30 [W] Have been in a variety of roles from everything from technical committee Vice chair to the release management team.
00:06:41 [W] So I work a lot on the contributor guide and the in-person training. We have called Upstream Institute. I have also done a lot of work with the women of openstack, which is now our diversity and inclusion working group, but other than open staff I've also been
00:06:56 [W] Kubernative Community since 2019 in Sig cloud provider specifically provider openstack and sick contributor experience when I'm not working on open source.
00:07:12 [W] I really love to travel which unfortunately we're not getting to do right now a whole lot, but that just gives me more time to go out and explore and take photos and watch more Harry Potter and Doctor Who and
00:07:23 [W] introduced himself
00:07:26 [W] Hello, I'm shefaly below. You may remember me from open source software community that are not communities because I'm new in here as jean-philippe might be hard to pronounce for the non French speakers.
00:07:40 [W] You can call me JP.
00:07:43 [W] I am working for Souza and I've been involved in multiple open source projects. I got like them like openstack story when member of the technical committee and reviewer in a few projects.
00:07:56 [W] What defines me is that I love
00:07:56 [W] To learn new things if you are looking for conversation starters with me, I put you a list of topics through emojis down there in the slide.
00:08:10 [W] You can even combine them together a good example of an icebreaker would be why do you call these french fries though?
00:08:19 [W] They are obviously better in Belgium. Another good example is why does that beer Emoji looks so disgusting with the phone outside and not
00:08:26 [W] inside the glass
00:08:29 [W] So today we're going to talk about the stages of life not just for a person but also through a person in an open source community and the open source project itself will go through the kind of Life events explain them on
00:08:47 [W] In scales and all the similarities between them.
00:08:52 [W] so we'll walk through all of that while we also walk through this graph which I hope you are familiar with so this is the Gartner hype cycle. Generally it tells the typical
00:09:06 [W] Software project everything from the very beginning with R&D and early adopters going growing rapidly and visibility up to the peak of inflated expectations.
00:09:21 [W] Where mass media is picked up and helped with the the hype cycle and then you move through to maybe some negative press supplier failures that sort of thing and then on towards the plateau of productivity
00:09:32 [W] Hopefully in most people's lives would be like retirement.
00:09:40 [W] But without further Ado we'll get started JP.
00:09:42 [W] yeah, so what's interesting in graphs is that without to clearly Define access and scale it can mean everything and nothing for example in this case will change the why the vertical axis
00:09:59 [W] Perceived fun Factor access I think the resulting graph can match given in personal life or even in Project Life.
00:10:09 [W] And your first stages in life Czar the childhood and Adolescence phases.
00:10:19 [W] I hope you can relate this graph when people are younger they are supposed to be in an always increasing curve fun slowly starting then drawing fast and then slowing down
00:10:31 [W] Apply to me when I was a kid.
00:10:35 [W] I had tons of fun.
00:10:37 [W] Let's talk about this.
00:10:38 [W] So this was my class when I was a kid.
00:10:45 [W] Most of my friends were white boys.
00:10:46 [W] Yes.
00:10:47 [W] That's what this Emoji is because that's sadly the monocultural environment that was raised in when I was a kid. My whole life was at school eating stuff sports playing games with my friends.
00:11:01 [W] Both games with certain group of friends computer games with another and well you get the gist and basically I learned to play games with friends and mostly in small groups.
00:11:17 [W] I consider that I was like a kid because there was very little I had to worry about and when I grew up the fan factors that it is slow down because I had tests and exams, but it was
00:11:28 [W] Even during that those tests periods.
00:11:33 [W] I was still playing games and having fun.
00:11:36 [W] I finally remember when a friend lent me is Nintendo during my exams.
00:11:42 [W] My parents hated it though, but that's another topic.
00:11:44 [W] And guess what?
00:11:49 [W] It's no fun the same for an open source project.
00:11:53 [W] You are in a new class a new class of software.
00:11:58 [W] You do something different than the other class of software before you it regroups people that are very similar with it at with identical problems.
00:12:05 [W] And that's the start.
00:12:07 [W] Thanks the monoculture you start with you're having some fun with the people which contribute to the project like you this is your small group of friends having the same needs. We're which you have fun and you learn
00:12:19 [W] Again, it's in small groups and there is a strong outside or effect in there and there is probably terrible docks as people learn from each other.
00:12:28 [W] At the beginning of your project you don't care about many things except getting in your code to work. So you don't worry too much about your project Community Building because you might think the community will grow automatically with the workability of your code
00:12:44 [W] You feel good because you see new people joining the small group.
00:12:49 [W] Keep in mind that the project has this test to the project. Sometimes I have hiccups.
00:12:58 [W] So to make this fun to set up what you don't really want to set up like ci/cd.
00:13:04 [W] example, if you're not the ci/cd person would have to work on things that are broken if you want to focus on acting on some new code.
00:13:13 [W] Imagine yourself as a new contributor of a project at first you only want to get your first contributions it it's fun.
00:13:26 [W] You're learning from the other people having the same problems.
00:13:31 [W] You might get lucky and have someone mentoring you or maybe you ask one on one questions with someone on a Communication channel.
00:13:39 [W] The next stage is to start to help to help other others.
00:13:40 [W] Sorry and learn some more by participating in projects life.
00:13:44 [W] But yes, it can get a little less fun.
00:13:50 [W] It's a little less fun when the tests are passing.
00:13:52 [W] For example, you know have to care about the test.
00:13:54 [W] You have to figure out and fix it.
00:13:58 [W] But at the end you're even happier because you achieved to merge something and you help the community at the same time.
00:14:03 [W] kids and as like new contributors to a community and as a new community are first and foremost fun like fun is what drives everything the excitement and in turn the visibility and
00:14:29 [W] um everything the excitement and in turn the visibility and the other side of that is growth you want to grow as a community and grow as a project and grow as a person and work towards like later adolescence
00:14:40 [W] Later adolescence and early adulthood into being an actual adult but the problems with this that you run into down the road our that you're not being as focused on things like documentation
00:14:53 [W] Or cementing processes as you could be and so you often have to recalibrate further down the road. You're not preparing for the future because you're more focused on fun and growing up.
00:15:08 [W] You don't know what's going to happen.
00:15:09 [W] You don't know what you're going to have to account for. So what we learned during childhood is that you don't want to think so much about the future that you inhibit growth, but you also don't want a girl records recklessly and have to pick up the pieces later on but it is important
00:15:23 [W] A big part of any project but it's not the be-all end-all of the future.
00:15:30 [W] So moving into adulthood now adulthood as like a stage of life.
00:15:38 [W] I'd like to think I'm an adult most days definitely not as fun as it was as a kid.
00:15:44 [W] You have a lot more responsibilities now, I like help take care of a house and I have to pay rent or help with the mortgage.
00:15:51 [W] I you know have to work have all of those responsibilities focused on going about life day-to-day continuing to grow as much as I can.
00:16:01 [W] But having to do all of that and kind of re temper expectations about where I want to go in life and readjust goals. This is all things that you think about when you are a contributor in a project to
00:16:16 [W] Because there are so much work to be done.
00:16:25 [W] I know I have a to do list in openstack a mile long and another one in kubernative.
00:16:25 [W] isn't mile long but making friends in the community is what makes it all worth it all the overwhelming stress of everything building and maintaining those long-term connections with other contributors is my favorite part of my job
00:16:40 [W] Building and maintaining those long-term connections with other contributors is my favorite part of my job.
00:16:42 [W] They're my friends and my support network.
00:16:49 [W] I will do whatever I can to help them get jobs and if I needed a job, I would like to think that would do the same for me.
00:16:53 [W] So you work on growth and Community roles figuring out what those goals are might also be difficult. There are so many different roles and every community and they're all defined differently and zettabytes.
00:17:03 [W] Lee different so like an openstack you have Korra viewer and a PT L and T C and all of this alphabet soup and there are similar roles in the kubernative community would like maintainers and
00:17:18 [W] Community and they're all defined differently and subtly different.
00:17:19 [W] So like an openstack you have Korra viewer and a PT L and T C and all of this alphabet soup, and there are similar roles in the kubernative community.
00:17:19 [W] It would like maintainers and like Sig chair and stuff like that and figuring out which roles you want to work towards can also be hard if you're focuses on non-traditional contributions that
00:17:30 [W] It's not just code and docks all the tenth time.
00:17:36 [W] Maybe you want to help with the Sig contributor experience. For example.
00:17:37 [W] And once you achieve these goals you realize there's even more responsibility you go from working towards buying the house.
00:17:48 [W] And then now you have to maintain the house.
00:17:51 [W] So you work towards achieving this role in the community. And then now there are even more meetings and there's more things you want to do and there's no end to what is the next step?
00:18:01 [W] As a like open source project. There are events that happen all the time.
00:18:10 [W] They might be focused just on your project.
00:18:18 [W] They might also be hosted by a different community and you want to participate and help bridge the two communities your focus becomes on simplification because during childhood.
00:18:26 [W] Things go all the directions at once explore all the opportunities and now you kind of have to ring that back in and you kind of become the enemy of your own popularity where people are trying to do things that were not within the original scope and you have to
00:18:41 [W] And so there's a little bit more resource delegation and strategizing that you have to do especially if your project came about at the same time as one or two others that really weren't that different you have to distinguish yourself from them. And
00:18:57 [W] The solution or maybe there's a solution to a slightly different problem.
00:19:05 [W] And what do you do with like all these contributions you're drowning and Patches from people and pull requests and they're like more things than you know what to do with and then
00:19:16 [W] Maybe at the same time or drowning people, but some of the original contributors are starting to move on and you have to adjust to that as well.
00:19:31 [W] Well, one of those things that in open source project should start to do is invest in the community working on communication and documentation kind of cleaning up the onboarding process.
00:19:40 [W] There are probably a lot of barriers or it's not clearly written down anywhere.
00:19:43 [W] So the documentation is important documentation is always the most important thing does not
00:19:47 [W] enough time and then the last thing that you do as a adults open source project is maybe kind of clarify the mission a little bit more and redefine it if you need to to help separate yourself from those other projects and kind
00:20:02 [W] Always the most important thing does not get enough time.
00:20:04 [W] And then the last thing that you do as a adults open source project is maybe kind of clarify the mission a little bit more and redefine it if you need to to help separate yourself from those other projects and kind of
00:20:05 [W] Ringing in on the sprawl that happens during childhood and the rapid growth.
00:20:09 [W] So next stage so during so during early adulthood of the project. We wanted to continuing we wanted to continue growing geometer people grow diversity.
00:20:26 [W] We are just goals we address the barrier of Entry like improved oximetry, but there were problems not everyone at the same expectations. The new girls don't feed everyone people are frustrations, and it's more work than you
00:20:39 [W] That's a mandatory but there were problems not everyone had the same expectations. The new girls don't feed everyone people are frustrations and it's more work than you expected.
00:20:44 [W] So what we learned during adolescence and early adulthood is that it starts about everyone in one-to-one fashion, like it wasn't childhood.
00:20:52 [W] So we had to deal with onboarding differently.
00:20:54 [W] We understood the need to simplify delegative strategize.
00:20:57 [W] We need to do something for the project and we can't because we can't continue losing people. We can't continue having the tractors.
00:21:06 [W] So after early, I don't hurt you might enter the next phase the midlife crisis we could argue that some projects don't go through that crisis, but some individuals and projects do so, let's talk about it.
00:21:21 [W] So after the the adulthood you enter face when you have more uncertainties, you doubt about achievements in life about its goals.
00:21:37 [W] You want to take drastic changes in your lifestyle and feel the wish to change paths decisions or events.
00:21:39 [W] You might be asking yourself.
00:21:43 [W] Why do I have to deal with all of that?
00:21:46 [W] I don't know this too tedious to annoy.
00:21:50 [W] I cannot take a little bit more fun where I can how can I find inevitability of life and there comes the midlife crisis you can you can argue a Faith No More song in your
00:22:01 [W] You doubt about achievements in life about its goals. You want to take drastic changes in your lifestyle and feel the wish to change paths decisions or events.
00:22:03 [W] You might be asking yourself.
00:22:03 [W] Why do I have to deal with all of that?
00:22:03 [W] I don't know this too tedious to annoying. I cannot take a little bit more firm where I can I can I find inevitability of life and there comes the midlife crisis you can you can
00:22:05 [W] And but then you realize it just a moment and your choir more wisdom your plan the for continuous continued growth after recalibrating your expectations.
00:22:19 [W] You have planned for continuous continued growth after recalibrating your expectations.
00:22:21 [W] So yes, the parallel applies to open source projects again, the project will go through uncertainties as they will as they are still detractors.
00:22:29 [W] It will still be there.
00:22:31 [W] There are still many problem talkers and not enough problem solvers.
00:22:38 [W] You will reach a phase where you want or you heard people wanting to change decisions or events for openstack example was the big tent was not a good idea.
00:22:49 [W] Was it a good choice?
00:22:51 [W] Well, now you question yourself a little more some of those conversations and questions lead to extra courses changes by realizing community and by realizing as a community that Dell many processes that
00:23:07 [W] Should be simplified this process is that you might have hide it in early adulthood face in openstack.
00:23:17 [W] For example, we learned a lot about new decisions and we discussed seller about you decisions and previous events again the big tent I should probably explain what the big tent
00:23:31 [W] I'm the tldr of it.
00:23:39 [W] Is that the big tent exploded the list of openstack projects allowing them to be official openstack projects at the end, which is something I guess we could talk more about during the
00:23:49 [W] You have the maturity cycle the big tent help grow the amount of software you increase the diversity increase the coverage of openstack user needs making complex type more mature and more malleable even though there are
00:24:05 [W] It's in the big tent that have now rightfully died since the time of the big tent the clear scope of the big tent was a good thing in my opinion anyway
00:24:20 [W] Of the big tent was a good thing in my opinion. Anyway enough talking about openstack.
00:24:25 [W] It's possible at the time at the time that midlife crisis happens that people leave the community for new Chinese.
00:24:33 [W] But yes people also join your project and the crisis of the downfall of contribution of contributions stop.
00:24:44 [W] We learn to deal where the contributors we have.
00:24:51 [W] We have some kind of constant some kind of stability.
00:24:59 [W] And so we focused on boarding and and work with a reduced group of people invest in them.
00:25:01 [W] Have fun with them.
00:25:03 [W] Enjoy the work together and that happened because of the ever readjusting course focused.
00:25:09 [W] Before we talk about the next step in in in cycle of life.
00:25:24 [W] I wanted to share my experiences along temperature for project for which uncertainties also happen at some point. If you are longtime contributor to a project you might be getting worried about what you're doing
00:25:33 [W] We have some kind of constant some kind of stability.
00:25:34 [W] And so we focused on boarding and and work with a reduced group of people invest in them.
00:25:35 [W] Have fun with them.
00:25:35 [W] Enjoy the work together and that happened because of the ever readjusting course focused.
00:25:35 [W] Before we talk about the next step in the cycle of life.
00:25:37 [W] I wanted to share my experiences along temperature for project for which uncertainties also happen at some point. If you are longtime contributor to a project you might be getting worried about what you're doing when you're heading might be concerned
00:25:39 [W] Software defines you forever have a lot of a label on you.
00:25:42 [W] You haven't certainty about the next step and might want to change the course of your career like starting to raise chip in the mountains instead of doing software development.
00:25:53 [W] I think it's fair to say it's normal to think about Kyle your movement and it's normal to test or not you Chinese software and you have to make peace with you or other people doing it.
00:26:02 [W] It's normal that your friends from the same project.
00:26:06 [W] Eject might feel the same and what I found nice myself is that during the time I worked on a project. I've established some nice relationship that I wish to keep.
00:26:16 [W] Maybe they won't be on the same next open source project as I do but maybe it's going to be the one after that. And in fact, that's the part. I I like I leave with that's my constant constant during
00:26:29 [W] The relationships I've built in the open source communities.
00:26:34 [W] Their heart but they're not the end there is so they're just as much about growth as childhood is it's just more of a recalibration and a reset then starting from scratch.
00:26:57 [W] It's that recalibration that you do that sets you up for the rest of your life and eventually retirement where you've made peace with where you are and the path that you're on but you're still growing and
00:27:08 [W] Is moving forward so moving on to the you know the rest of adulthood and hopefully someday retirement.
00:27:20 [W] I know I would like to retire some day what I understand a retirement not being there yet is that there's a lot less pressure to grow and evolve and that makes your life generally more relaxed.
00:27:35 [W] Stable at this point.
00:27:42 [W] there's not a whole lot of growth or of like backward steps which could mean a lot of different things depending on where you are specifically and your life, but I imagine you like have your budgets
00:27:53 [W] / then and you're paying bills or maybe you're completely done paying off loans and a hundred percent debt free.
00:28:02 [W] I'm getting there but you know, obviously there's always going to be more debt to acquire to but everything is self driven you are motivated by your own wants and what you want to do more than working for this employer or
00:28:15 [W] This loan or whatever everything is more focused on you and what you want to do.
00:28:23 [W] So what that looks like as a contributor to like a stable open source project is that you've spent a lot of time preaching with other communities and working together.
00:28:36 [W] So you're making these new connections.
00:28:41 [W] I have spent a good amount of time over the last two years working on kubernative.
00:28:47 [W] He's bridging that Community with the openstack community because there's a lot of good that can be done together. If we you know are a little bit more mindful about what's going on in this community and that community
00:28:54 [W] That's so new friends.
00:28:59 [W] There's your you never stop making friends and open source.
00:29:00 [W] That's for sure.
00:29:01 [W] You see a lot of the same people and there's a lot of the same connections, but there are always new people that are joining this project or that project that you get to meet and connect with and then old friends. They obviously stick around to
00:29:15 [W] the same people keep coming back around and they're understanding if you leave a community because hopefully your, you know, really good friends with that person and it doesn't matter how long it's been since you've seen them you might run into
00:29:31 [W] Friends and enjoy can copy with them.
00:29:34 [W] and then like the last facet of this is retirement for an open source project doesn't actually mean like retired it can still be around and used but there is going
00:29:50 [W] Outreach that I was talking about going to other communities and events and doing talks and Bridging the communities together so that we can solve more problems and grow more and continue to evolve but the focus is clear.
00:30:06 [W] There's a lot more clarity now than there ever was before and things are kind of settled and stable for the foreseeable future potentially forever, but realizing that one project can't solve all the
00:30:21 [W] Lems gives you much better focus on like your goal as a project in your direction and since one project can't solve all the problems.
00:30:33 [W] We need to work together and since we're working together and we have all of this Clarity and focus things are a lot more stable than they were you might be in maintenance mode and not taking on a bunch of new
00:30:46 [W] As a project in your direction and since one project can't solve all the problems.
00:30:47 [W] We need to work together and since we're working together and we have all of this Clarity and focus things are a lot more stable than they were you might be in maintenance mode and not taking on a bunch of new
00:30:50 [W] Stuff and that's totally fine.
00:30:50 [W] You might be you know focused on lowering technical debt still and simplification and that's that's good.
00:30:56 [W] That's a different sort of stability and maybe you're just keeping requirements up-to-date different sort of stability.
00:31:08 [W] So let JP kind of give us some final words here.
00:31:10 [W] Yeah, so a quick recap would be that further. The fun factor is not a constant of a time and it's normal.
00:31:22 [W] So projects should try to calibrate fun moments with less fun and make things fun where you can second part was that any investment in lowering tekton
00:31:34 [W] Process is have easy onboarding and other contributions are good anything you can take their ticket and the last bit is that having a clear Focus?
00:31:50 [W] Don't hesitate to adapt your focus based on the world's needs adapter with other projects communicate with other projects.
00:32:03 [W] It's not only you and your friends like you it's for you your friends and your future new friends, and that's
00:32:09 [W] why we are committee.
00:32:13 [W] Thank you.
00:32:14 [W] Hello.
00:32:26 [W] So any questions yet, but if you have them, please send them in and we'd love to answer them or if you think of any later both JP and I are in the
00:32:44 [W] Slack channel for the event.
00:32:50 [W] So if you don't have anything right now, we're definitely available past the end of the session as well.
00:32:53 [W] I definitely hope that you liked our vision of the dice between the person the death of a project and that's when we met well if you maintain your help maintain
00:33:12 [W] Hope you remember I would say or I'll message here and remember those slides to chew. You have to cheer you up.
00:33:23 [W] up. Sorry in some of the bad moments, but also in the good moments and I hope it will help you continue building your community.
00:33:33 [W] We need more open source.
00:33:40 [W] Anything we can do to help each other out as communities is is really important.
00:33:42 [W] So well, thank you all for coming.
00:33:48 [W] We really appreciate it and hope you enjoyed our talk today.
