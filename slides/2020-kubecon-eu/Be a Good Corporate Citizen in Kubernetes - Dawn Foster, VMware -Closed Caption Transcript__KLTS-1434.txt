00:03:45 [W] Welcome to my talk about being a good corporate Citizen and kubenetes.
00:08:57 [W] First I'll tell you a bit about me.
00:09:03 [W] I've spent more than 20 years working in the technology industry and most of that time.
00:09:09 [W] I've been working on open source projects from within a variety of different companies.
00:09:14 [W] I've been the director of community at puppet and Community lead for Intel zippin Source Technology Center.
00:09:24 [W] I also have a PhD from the University of Greenwich in London that I got by researching how people working at many different companies collaborate.
00:09:28 [W] Within the Linux kernel before the VMware a position of pivotal. I was also responsible for driving pivotal roles kubernative contribution strategy and I was actively contributing to kubernative swith in the contributor experience sake
00:09:43 [W] If in the cncf contributor expect contributor strategy Sig in particular the governance working group.
00:10:03 [W] I'm also a board member of open UK, which is focused on developing and sustaining leadership and open technology here in the UK.
00:10:13 [W] I'm a governing board member and maintainer for the Linux foundations. Chaos project, which is focused on using metrics to evaluate the health of Open Source projects. I'm also on The Advisory board for butter GM just a company that builds up its arse Health metrics -
00:10:24 [W] boards
00:10:24 [W] My work is an open source software has focused on both growing participation and Company driven open source projects and in helping our employees collaborate within large Foundation driven projects like the work that I've been doing with in kubernative and
00:10:40 [W] often ecosystem projects
00:10:43 [W] Let's start by talking about how collaboration Works within kubenetes and these complex interactions between individuals employers and the communities while I'm talking specifically about kubernative.
00:10:59 [W] He's in this talk much of this also applies to other open source projects.
00:11:03 [W] Your contributions to kubenetes are centered around you as an individual contributions come from individuals rather than companies when someone submits a pull request to fix a bug add a feature or update some documentation Within kubernative.
00:11:20 [W] Your contributions to kubenetes are centered around you as an individual contributions come from individuals rather than companies when someone submits a pull request to fix a bug add a feature or update some documentation Within
00:11:22 [W] But change comes from an individual commits usually include a name and an email address, but in many cases unless someone uses their Corporate email address.
00:11:33 [W] You can't even tell where a person works as individuals.
00:11:37 [W] There are plenty of opportunities to move into positions of leadership within the community and these are all documented in more detail as links off of the Community page on GitHub, but I wanted to provide a short overview to help people
00:11:50 [W] He structure within kubernative.
00:11:55 [W] He's the starting point is here at the bottom as an org member after you've made a few contributions and this allows people to assign each issues and other activities and GitHub after you have a history of making solid contributions and
00:12:07 [W] People's contributions. You can make a reviewer and eventually an approver.
00:12:17 [W] these roles are documented in owners files, which indicate the parts of the repository where you have those responsibilities most of the work within kubernative happens across the dozens of special interest groups and working groups, which I'll talk about later
00:12:27 [W] most of the work with a kubernative happens across the dozens of special interest groups and working groups, which I'll talk about later and each of these can have multiple set of projects and each of those are projects also has leaves assigned and at the very top
00:12:35 [W] Jax and each of those are projects also has leaves assigned and at the very top is the kubenetes steering committee, which is an elected governing body with oversight over the entire project to make all of
00:12:44 [W] Ding for employers the leadership positions within kubernative.
00:12:51 [W] He's staying with the individual if that person moves to a new company and let's face it kubernative skills are in high demand.
00:12:59 [W] So you see quite a bit of movement between employers for example within the past year or so.
00:13:05 [W] We've seen a couple of people on the steering committee and many other leads change employers since an employee can take their leadership position in our project and the next job companies are well served.
00:13:15 [W] To make sure that they keep these contributors happy.
00:13:19 [W] In the communities project as I mentioned, there is no direct way for companies to participate other than dedicating time from Individual employees who contribute on behalf of the company, which is becoming increasingly common across
00:13:35 [W] and of Open Source projects, I work at VMware and we have loads of people working full-time on kubernative similarly companies like red hat Google Microsoft Intel and loads of others employ people to work on kubernative
00:13:50 [W] day job
00:13:53 [W] if you don't already have employees with the skills to contribute to kubernative use you might be able to hire an existing contributor or possibly even a lead as an employee to do the work on the project on your behalf in addition to devoting time from your
00:14:08 [W] Jack the cncf also relies on funding that comes from Member companies to fund infrastructure events and other project needs and I'll talk more about all this later since corporate involvement in kubernative.
00:14:24 [W] He's is indeed the main focus for this particular presentation.
00:14:26 [W] The kubernative community is made up of a wide variety of individuals who are working together to make a brunette. He's awesome. When I talk about Community. I'm including all of the people who work on the project this includes Developers.
00:14:42 [W] Management testing localization and anyone else who contributes to the project?
00:14:49 [W] Application developers who are using the kubernative apis and other features to build things that will run on top of your buddies users. The people who run kubernative use day-to-day in their environments and hopefully
00:15:04 [W] feedback to the project along the way people like me who are working for vendors and companies who create their products based on kubernative other contributors include people working on promotion organizing meetups doing documentation and so
00:15:20 [W] Our sort of thankless tasks and some of these people contribute as part of their day job on behalf of an employer While others contribute in their free time, and they're all important parts of the community in open source communities.
00:15:36 [W] I've also had so many small world moments where people that I've worked with and past projects pop up again, and again in other communities that I'm a part of when I first joined the contributor experience Sig
00:15:50 [W] I saw several people that I had known for previous communities.
00:15:55 [W] It's important to keep in mind that you are likely to run into these same individuals again and again, so be thoughtful and kind when working with others. If you're a big jerk in one Community. It is likely that
00:16:11 [W] So be thoughtful and kind when working with others. If you're a big jerk in one Community. It is likely that other people will remember this and bring your reputation with them into new projects, which can reflect badly on you
00:16:18 [W] Bring your reputation with them into new projects, which can reflect badly on you and on your company as an employer.
00:16:22 [W] It's worth doing a bit of due diligence to see how someone has behaved in other open source communities before you have them contribute to kill Burnett. He's on your behalf.
00:16:32 [W] This individual employer and Community Triad creates unique challenges as an individual contributed kubenetes or any other open source project.
00:16:48 [W] There will be times when you will need to find ways to Great balance between what your employer wants you to do and doing the right thing for the kubernetes community which can create really awkward and uncomfortable conversations with your
00:16:59 [W] Will be times when you will need to find ways to create balance between what your employer wants you to do and doing the right thing for the kubernative community which can create really awkward and uncomfortable conversations with your managers
00:17:00 [W] The worst-case scenario is when there are direct conflicts and what your employer wants you to do would go against the best interest of the kubernative community at times like these you'll need to be diplomatic.
00:17:16 [W] It can help to ask some questions to understand what your company needs to accomplish and see if you can find another creative way to meet this need in a way that aligns with the needs of the community.
00:17:29 [W] Sometimes this won't be possible and you'll need to go back.
00:17:31 [W] To your company and explain why what they want just isn't going to happen, which is one of those really awkward and uncomfortable discussions as an employer. You can make this easier on your contributors by taking the time
00:17:46 [W] Stand the types of kubenetes contributions that will be welcomed by the community.
00:17:55 [W] It's important to have regular conversations with your contributors to understand what the project needs and to learn how you can work with in the community.
00:18:06 [W] You can help your employees be successful by being careful not to push your employees to do things that aren't in the best interest of the community personally. I've been in a couple of situations where I've left.
00:18:17 [W] Companies because of this conflict and other open source projects and I know lots of really amazing people who've done the same thing kubenetes contributors are in high demand.
00:18:32 [W] So helping your employees avoid these conflicts in the first place will help you retain this great talent.
00:18:36 [W] Now that we have a better idea of how collaboration works and kubenetes next up.
00:18:43 [W] We'll talk about how to build a kubernative contribution strategy and plan for your company.
00:18:47 [W] Before the VMware acquisition of pivotal I was responsible for creating our kubernative contribution strategy one key to having a successful strategy for your open source contributions is to align them with the overall business goals for
00:19:03 [W] If you're open source contributions don't support the overall strategies for your organization.
00:19:14 [W] You will drastically reduce the chance of being successful by taking some time and effort to make sure you support your overall corporate strategy, then it will be much easier to justify continuing these efforts during the next
00:19:26 [W] Organization.
00:19:32 [W] This is why I started by looking at pivotal as corporate and product strategies when writing kubernative contribution strategies.
00:19:36 [W] I made sure that I could show our show how our work on kubernative supported our overall goals as a company.
00:19:47 [W] This can really help make the case to Senior Management and Company Executives who are not likely to be involved in the low-level details of the project explaining how your kubernative contributions support the goals of the company.
00:19:57 [W] Can help the exact team understand the importance of this work.
00:20:01 [W] on the other hand when your goals are not clearly aligned with the overall strategy people will look at your participation in the kubernetes community is something that could can just be cut or starved of resources with open source projects it is
00:20:17 [W] You to fall into the Trap of describing your contributions as something that can sound an awful lot like charity to an executive.
00:20:27 [W] There is a strong open source ethos of contributing to the common good of the project or what people often refer to as chop wood and carry water tasks. And these are really important. We all need to pitch
00:20:42 [W] In a variety of areas, but even many of these tasks and can be described in ways that help your Executives see why these tasks are also important.
00:20:55 [W] It's also a good idea to encourage employees to work on these activities when they're blocked on other tasks like maybe waiting for a pull request reviews.
00:21:01 [W] While some employees might see contributing to kubernative used to be its own reward having a solid strategy can also help employees understand how their work contributes to the success of the company as an employee.
00:21:16 [W] It's really nice to see that your work has an impact in helping the company achieve their goals.
00:21:22 [W] Most of the work within kubernative happens within the dozens of special interest groups working groups and other committees and as you can see from the slide, there are a lot of them.
00:21:38 [W] It can be overwhelming at first and it's unlikely that you will be able to have employees contribute to all of these areas.
00:21:48 [W] So you want to focus on a few areas that are the most important for you based on what you're trying to achieve as a company.
00:21:53 [W] Determining where you need to contribute within these areas is likely to be the focus of your kubernative contribution strategy at pivotal.
00:22:06 [W] Them it can be overwhelming at first and it's unlikely that you will be able to have employees contribute to all of these areas.
00:22:14 [W] So you want to focus on a few areas that are the most important for you based on what you're trying to achieve as a company determining where you need to contribute within these areas is likely to be the focus of your
00:22:15 [W] And both are short and long-term needs for the various kubernative Technologies.
00:22:23 [W] For example, we had customers asking for Windows support and we already had some people contributing within the windows special interest group.
00:22:31 [W] So that was included in the strategy as something that we needed to continue doing to support our current needs.
00:22:34 [W] We also had some efforts underway to start shifting our applications to run on top of kubernative so that over the longer term we could just run everything on kubernative.
00:22:43 [W] Eddie's to support those longer-term strategy.
00:22:50 [W] We had people start working with in Sig API Machinery since most of our product teams would eventually need to use the kubernetes API is and these are just a couple of couple of examples of where we decided to focus But ultimately you
00:23:02 [W] the best places for your employees to contribute if you aren't sure where to start contributor experience docks and release are all great things that are both friendly to newcomers and they help provide more insight into the overall project as
00:23:18 [W] out how kubernative really works
00:23:21 [W] since companies contribute to kubernative.
00:23:27 [W] He's by having employees participate and collaborate.
00:23:30 [W] You'll need to figure out how many people you need and what skills are required for those people and some cases you might have employees with the skills you need but this goes beyond just knowing the right Technologies or having particular specialized
00:23:43 [W] Contributing to any open source project like kubenetes requires some different skills than participating in internal projects.
00:23:56 [W] These people need to be comfortable and really ambiguous environments where they will receive feedback possibly difficult or negative feedback and they'll be expected to respond to this feedback in the public in a professional manner
00:24:06 [W] They'll also be providing feedback to other community members and keep in mind that not every engineer wants their work to be in the public Spotlight, which can feel like being under a microscope sometimes.
00:24:21 [W] If you don't have skills internally, you might be able to find existing kubernative contributors that you can hire.
00:24:33 [W] but you need to be just a little bit careful about this option two because you don't want to get a reputation for aggressively poaching employees from other companies.
00:24:43 [W] It requires a bit of nuance to make it known that you're interested in hiring people to work on kubernative without aggressively hiring them away from other employers.
00:24:48 [W] Now that you've figured out what you want to do.
00:24:56 [W] Let's talk about how to do it while being a good corporate Citizen and avoid some common but embarrassing mistakes.
00:25:00 [W] The first step is to join a Sig or working group. Now each cigarette working group is a little bit different but this usually means joining one or more mailing lists and slack channels.
00:25:14 [W] It's a good idea to always join the main mailing list for your Sig our working group so that you get project meeting invites and other important information. Then you should also join any relevant sub-project mailing lists are slack channels that you're interested in
00:25:29 [W] I'm zoning permits attending the Sig working group and some project meetings is a really great way to learn more about the current work, but the meetings are recorded so you can watch them later if you aren't able to attend the monthly
00:25:45 [W] Is another good meeting to attend or watch later to get an overview of what's Happening across the entire project.
00:25:56 [W] You'll also want to have a close look at a project documentation. Especially the contribution docks spend whatever time it takes to fully understand the contribution guidelines code of conduct another expectations for collaboration the
00:26:08 [W] And whatever time it takes to fully understand the contribution guidelines code of conduct another expectations for collaboration.
00:26:11 [W] The expectations for contributors are different for each project.
00:26:15 [W] So don't assume that you know how to contribute to kubernative. He's even if you have experience with other open source projects.
00:26:19 [W] Also note that most cigs and working groups have their own contribution guidelines the cover anything specific to their area.
00:26:29 [W] So you want to have a look at those two.
00:26:32 [W] The good news is the kubernative has a ton of really amazing documentation and virtual workshops for new contributors.
00:26:40 [W] So it should be fairly easy to understand how to get started.
00:26:41 [W] I also recommend taking the time to lurk in your Sig or working group to understand how people participate I have seen too many overeager new community members and various open source communities
00:26:56 [W] Community with both feet they make mistakes by violating Community Norms talking about things that aren't relevant and just generally kind of making a mess of things.
00:27:07 [W] everybody makes mistakes at some point, but some of them can be avoided by taking the time to learn about the community rather than barging in and try to be an active participant on day one.
00:27:21 [W] Don't be afraid to sit back while you learn from other community members by taking the time to observe and lurk for a bit. You can learn about how petabyte-scale
00:27:27 [W] People behave and get a feel for how people typically respond when you've spent some time understanding the expectations and how to contribute.
00:27:39 [W] You should start with something small like bug fixes to learn about the contribution process.
00:27:43 [W] A good place to start is by looking at the issues for your Sig or working group and finding ones that are tagged good first issue and after gaining some experience doing a couple of the good first issue issues.
00:27:57 [W] You can move onto an issue that you find interesting or you can look for issues tagged as Help Wanted which are issues that often require a bit more experience than get first issues, but are also great places to get involved.
00:28:10 [W] Once you start participating you should expect feedback in some cases. You might need to have hard discussions with people about the merits of your contribution, but you can focus on the problem deliver your feedback with a bit of kindness
00:28:25 [W] Issue and after gaining some experience doing a couple of the good first issue issues.
00:28:26 [W] You can move onto an issue that you find interesting or you can look for issues tagged as Help Wanted which are issues that often require a bit more experience than good first issues, but are also great places to get involved.
00:28:28 [W] Once you start participating you should expect feedback in some cases. You might need to have hard discussions with people about the merits of your contribution, but you can focus on the problem deliver your feedback with a bit of kindness and
00:28:30 [W] Also avoid any attacks on the other person for tough conversations. It can also help to have someone else read your response before you post it publicly to help catch any issues with tone that might make you sound more harsh than
00:28:41 [W] That might make you sound more harsh than you think you do.
00:28:47 [W] This is an incredibly difficult line to walk sometimes but staying professional and being kind to other people when responding to difficult feedback can make a big difference to your personal reputation and the reputation of your employer Within.
00:28:57 [W] Back can make a big difference to your personal reputation and the reputation of your employer within the kubernative community and many cases, especially when you're new to kubernative use. You should expect to iterate on the feedback
00:29:06 [W] Kubernative so you should expect to enter 8 on the feedback after you submit your changes to accommodate the first wave of feedback.
00:29:12 [W] You're likely to get more feedback on the changes you just made so just consider it an iterative process.
00:29:23 [W] This also means that you should plan for the time. It takes to get multiple ways of feedback submitting something at the last minute before a release window closes, and we do a code freeze and then
00:29:30 [W] It is just going to be frustrating for everyone involved.
00:29:36 [W] So give yourself plenty of time for multiple feedback and resubmit processes.
00:29:39 [W] After you get past those first few small contributions, you'll want to make sure that you spend time discussing proposed changes in your Sig or working group before you start making them these discussions usually happen in Sig or
00:29:57 [W] Or in GitHub issues by talking about these contributions very early in the process.
00:30:08 [W] You can make sure that they will be consistent with the expectations of the project.
00:30:11 [W] You can also learn about anyone else who might be working in similar areas to hopefully avoid conflicting changes.
00:30:22 [W] That won't work together. Once they're merged these discussions also avoid surprising people especially for new features or other really big changes.
00:30:27 [W] It can also help to break big changes into smaller easier to digest contributions.
00:30:36 [W] It's a lot easier for maintainers to find time to provide feedback on smaller contributions and it gives you time to make Corrections. If anything you're doing maybe isn't quite right.
00:30:45 [W] This allows you to iterate on the feedback. There's several contributions making it less likely to have bigger fundamental issues with your contribution.
00:30:52 [W] It's also important to keep in mind that you don't really have any control over other participants in the project.
00:31:01 [W] This is different from working within a company where you can escalate any issues to managers who can work to resolve problems.
00:31:09 [W] If not, Annex, non-responsive employees in kubernative another open source projects. You don't have a strict chain of command or other ways to exert control over the people you collaborate with and instead you should strive to be
00:31:21 [W] total issues with your contribution
00:31:27 [W] It's also important to keep in mind that you don't really have any control over other participants in the project.
00:31:27 [W] This is different from working within a company where you can escalate any issues to managers who can work to resolve problems.
00:31:29 [W] If not, Annex, non-responsive employees in kubernative another open source projects. You don't have a strict chain of command or other ways to exert control over the people you collaborate with and instead you should strive to be
00:31:31 [W] Find and easy to work with since you may need to find other ways to influence people to respond to your pull requests or your patches.
00:31:34 [W] Community members and especially leaders within the kubernative community should expect to spend some time helping to bring up the next wave of new contributors and as employers. We should plan to have our contributors put some effort into this.
00:31:46 [W] Onto your pull requests or your patches.
00:31:47 [W] Community members and especially leaders within the kubernative community should expect to spend some time helping to bring up the next wave of new contributors and as employers. We should plan to have our contributors put some effort into this.
00:31:48 [W] experienced kubenetes contributors manager of Junior employees to help them get started in the community or it could mean participating in the many mentoring programs that are available within the kubernative community meet our contributors
00:32:04 [W] Where anyone can join to ask questions of experienced contributors?
00:32:09 [W] We also have Shadow programs where a new person can Shadow and experience contributor for a specific role.
00:32:20 [W] This was first adopted within the release team where each release has a leader for every role on the release team. And each of those leaders has a couple of Shadows when the new team is formed for the next release the leads for each
00:32:32 [W] Roll on the release team and each of those leaders has a couple of Shadows when the new team is formed for the next release the leads for each role or usually selected from the previous Shadows.
00:32:37 [W] So this is a great way to move into a leadership position while the shadow program started within the release team.
00:32:43 [W] It's also been expanding into other areas of the project so you can find these shadow opportunities in different areas.
00:32:49 [W] Whenever you can, you should try to find Opportunities to sponsor new contributors.
00:32:57 [W] Now. This term is a little bit confusing since a lot of people think of financial sponsorship. But in this case it means using your position in the project to advocate for someone who might not otherwise have the same
00:33:09 [W] It's going to be simple as recommending someone to help out some part of the project.
00:33:21 [W] Sponsor someone for org membership or maybe recommending someone is a new reviewer or approver.
00:33:23 [W] This is especially important for the underrepresented folks. That might be overlooked or might not be as forthcoming about asking for a readership role.
00:33:33 [W] A lot of the work that we do in kubenetes and other open source projects is based on the relationships we have with other people my PhD research was based on collaboration in the Linux kernel and as part of that research
00:33:49 [W] Bunch of Kernel developers in all of the interviews they talked about about the importance of their relationships with other people almost all of them talked about how existing relationship made it easier to collaborate with others.
00:34:05 [W] All of the people that I interviewed mentioned in person collaboration at conferences and other meetings as something that was important people talked about how it was sometimes easier to work through a really difficult big issues at conferences.
00:34:20 [W] You negate with someone online if you've met them before and maybe share a meal or a drink or just had a nice conversation with them knowing the human being on the other side of the keyboard can make a bigger difference than you might realize.
00:34:35 [W] Now granted this is a bit harder right now given the current pandemic at all. But we're making do with virtual events like this one with video calls if your employees are contributing to kubernative.
00:34:51 [W] He's then you should encourage them to attend keep Khan and kubenetes contributor Summits even attending virtually by having some key employees attend those conferences.
00:35:00 [W] They can build deeper lasting relationships with others that will benefit your company and your other employees.
00:35:05 [W] I've spent a lot of time at open source conferences over the years and I have really deep and Lasting connections with people that I've met at those events. Now when I need to do something new or have a question, I usually know someone
00:35:21 [W] Lasting relationships with others that will benefit your company and your other employees.
00:35:22 [W] I've spent a lot of time at open source conferences over the years and I have really deep and Lasting connections with people that I've met at those events.
00:35:23 [W] Now when I need to do something new or have a question, I usually know someone who can point me in the right direction and I often make introductions for other employees to people outside of the company who can help us learn something new.
00:35:32 [W] Or maybe just solve some tricky issue.
00:35:33 [W] Upstreaming your patches helps you become a good corporate citizen, but it also has quite a few internal benefits for your company.
00:35:49 [W] If you aren't familiar with upstreaming this just means that when you make patches to fix a bug or solve some internal need you submit those updates back into kubernative rather than continuing just to maintain them internally.
00:35:54 [W] When you maintain patches internally every time we kind of kubernative use release you need to go through the work of reapplying your patches and even possibly rewriting some of your patches if they touch bits of code that were changed in the release the side effect of the
00:36:10 [W] Release side effect of the sometimes difficult process is that people then tend to put off applying updates which can be a big problem if the release contains security fixes.
00:36:21 [W] Well, it takes more time up front.
00:36:26 [W] you're better off taking the time to submit these patches into kubernative. He's where they can be properly maintained as part of the project and where other people can benefit from them. The easier you can make it for your
00:36:36 [W] In tribute these changes back into kubernative.
00:36:45 [W] He's and other open source projects the better off you'll be in general Upstream patches is considered the right thing to do and open source projects, which will help maintain your company's status as a good corporate citizen.
00:36:54 [W] The kubernetes community is probably the friendliest and most welcoming community that I've ever been involved in largely because of their Community Values.
00:37:06 [W] I'm going to wrap up this talk with a discussion of the kubernative Community Values because these values do a really good job of summing up my advice for being a good corporate Citizen and kubernative.
00:37:22 [W] The slide is most of the Community Values but the full list can be found online along with descriptions for each one in kubernative distribution is better than centralization with a project as massive as kubernative.
00:37:33 [W] Is only viable through high trust and high visibility distribution of work.
00:37:44 [W] So Authority decision-making technical design code ownership and documentation is delegated to the various special interest groups working groups and committees.
00:37:54 [W] This is why I recommend that you focus on particular cigs and working groups when building your strategies and have each employee Focus their energy on at most a couple of areas.
00:38:01 [W] Inclusive is better than xclusive within the kubernative community successful technology requires different perspectives and different skills, which are easier to achieve in a welcoming and respectful environment community.
00:38:17 [W] Kubernative he's is a privilege not a right and Leadership is earned through your contributions.
00:38:27 [W] We show respect for the time and effort put into a contribution regardless of whether the contributor is brand new to the community or whether they're a veteran of the project.
00:38:40 [W] your employees need to be prepared to engage with people in a way that's respectful and kind while showing appreciation for the hard work of other contributors.
00:38:48 [W] In kubernative evolution is better than stagnation this not only refers to technological Evolution, but also includes continual Improvement servant leadership and mentorship.
00:39:04 [W] It's the duty for leaders in the community to find sponsor and promote new community members leaders should expect to eventually step aside community members should expect to step up.
00:39:17 [W] You're experienced employee contributors should expect to spend some time mentoring and or sponsoring newer contributors.
00:39:28 [W] These could be other employees interns Google summer of code students or anyone else looking for a new opportunity to participate.
00:39:35 [W] Kubernative he's values community over product or company.
00:39:41 [W] First you've technological Evolution but also includes continual Improvement servant leadership and mentorship.
00:39:49 [W] It's the duty for leaders in the community to find sponsor and promote new community members leaders should expect to eventually step aside community members should expect to step up.
00:39:50 [W] You're experienced employee contributors should expect to spend some time mentoring and or sponsoring newer contributors.
00:39:51 [W] These could be other employees interns Google summer of code students or anyone else looking for a new opportunity to participate.
00:39:53 [W] Kubernative values community over product or company. So it's important for your employees to think of the needs of the Community First for the benefit of all its members and users everywhere
00:39:56 [W] Users everywhere individuals gain status through their work in the community and companies gain status through their commitments to support this community by providing the contributors required for the project to operate this goes back to when I was talking about that
00:40:03 [W] Bitter is required for the project to operate this goes back to when I was talking about that balance between individuals companies and the community as an employer.
00:40:10 [W] It's in your best interest to make it easy for your employees to prioritize the needs of the community and not try to push your own agenda when it isn't in the best interest of the overall kubernative community.
00:40:24 [W] With that, I will say thank you and open it up for questions.
00:40:30 [W] Okay, welcome to the live q a portion of the talk.
00:40:41 [W] I have a couple of questions on slack. Then. I'm going to answer. So Eric asked about additional advice for employees to create and maintain these relationships now that we're in this fully virtual remote world
00:40:52 [W] If you a portion of the talk, I have a couple of questions on slack that I'm going to answer.
00:40:53 [W] So Eric asked about additional advice for employees to create and maintain these relationships now that we're in this fully virtual remote world and whether there are any options for day-to-day stuff Beyond like these types of virtual conferences.
00:40:57 [W] Options for day-to-day stuff Beyond like these types of virtual conferences and I would say that my biggest piece of advice is to join in on Project meetings whenever you can so I spend actually a lot of time in Project meetings.
00:41:08 [W] The chaos bra jecht and we have weekly meetings for the entire project. But also weekly meetings for different working groups and sub projects.
00:41:18 [W] So I attend a lot of those same thing for kubernative use and some cncf groups that I'm a part of so I would say take advantage of any like ongoing project meetings that happen as a way to get some Face Time granted via Zoom or something similar with
00:41:31 [W] going project meetings that happen as a way to get some Face Time granted via Zoom or something similar with people who are working on the project and also engaging with people and slack like we're doing right now is also also helpful you get to know some people that
00:41:38 [W] And also engaging with people and slack like we're doing right now is also also helpful you get to know some people that you might not otherwise meet in person.
00:41:43 [W] Jeffrey had another question of this is a hard question sharing an example of when corporate and open source projects conflicted and what you learned from it so early in my career. I was
00:41:56 [W] That no longer exists the company when I joined them was in the process of there was a massive Fork. So there were some problems with the company that I had joined and the community decided to take the project and
00:42:12 [W] Reasonable reasonably good reasons for doing that given some of the stuff that was going on in the project and I would say the biggest thing that I learned from that is that, you know, first of all, I need to be realistic about what I can fix as a,
00:42:28 [W] our director of community but also to spend a bit more time digging into the problems that I'm being hired to solve to see if it's something that is interesting to me that I want to solve and that realistically can be solved because
00:42:44 [W] Case there were some fundamental problems that that frankly there was there was no no chance of me solving the problems that were there are happening in this particular community.
00:42:59 [W] So it was kind of a kind of a bad situation to be in so I think I learned a lot about doing research in advance and deciding whether or not it's something that I really wanted to tackle.
00:43:09 [W] So it looks like the session is about over so I would encourage you I will stay in slack probably frankly most of the day in the community Channel because that's where a lot of the talks. I'm going to be.
00:43:15 [W] Be attending our so I would say join me there and we can keep the discussion going in the I think it's pound to keep con Community slack in the cncf slack.
00:43:28 [W] Thanks a bunch.
