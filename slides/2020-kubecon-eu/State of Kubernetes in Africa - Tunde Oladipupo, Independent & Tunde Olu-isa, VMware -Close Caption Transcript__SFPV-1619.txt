00:06:43 [W] Hi.
00:06:45 [W] Everyone welcome to the state of kubernative in Africa.
00:10:29 [W] My name is Judy a lollipop. Oh, I'm a devops engineer.
00:10:31 [W] I am about groaning infrastructure management. My recent focus on Clowny T deployment. And today I have with me my co-speaker how everyone I am. Trilio Lewis. I'm a site reliability
00:10:44 [W] Experience working as a devops engineer. Most recently.
00:10:49 [W] I've been working on kubenetes and the number of cloud native Technologies, and I'm happy to be here today.
00:10:59 [W] And so let's get right into it.
00:11:07 [W] So today we're going to be going over how and why we actually submitted to talk for state of communities in Africa, and then we're going to talk about the adoption of kubernative in in Africa and then
00:11:14 [W] We submitted a talk for state of kubernative in Africa.
00:11:17 [W] And then we're going to talk about the adoption of communities in in Africa. And then we look at some of the challenges that startups in Enterprises facing as they try to you know, the stats
00:11:23 [W] Enterprise's facing as they try to you know, the starts with their journey into using kubernative and then we're going to talk about the growth of the kubernative community also in Africa, and then we're going to talk about how
00:11:32 [W] The kubernative community also in Africa and then we're going to talk about how cncf can help with, you know with the adoption and also the community group and then we're lastly we're going to talk about how we all can
00:11:43 [W] You know with the adoption and also to grow two of the communities.
00:11:50 [W] So let's get right into it.
00:11:55 [W] How do we get into doing a talk on the state of communities in Africa?
00:12:02 [W] or yes how it all started?
00:12:03 [W] I think it was last year Ian tune. They were sitting right next to each other at a presentation going on at the coupon not America. And what we realized was that on the presentation slide. We were looking at it wasn't a lot of
00:12:19 [W] Of communities in Africa.
00:12:20 [W] Well, yes how it all started.
00:12:20 [W] I think it was last year Ian tune. They were sitting right next to each other at a presentation going on at the cube cannot America and what we realized was that on the presentation slide. We were looking at it wasn't a lot of
00:12:23 [W] The work that was being done in the kubernative space in Africa are not on the map that was being shown in the slide and you know, we started exploring that and we said to ourselves well.
00:12:35 [W] The conditioned be more representation.
00:12:39 [W] of Africa on the slide and we took on responsibilities and said we're going to go ahead and start exploring what's going on within the kubernative landscape in Africa right where he was that I think about how
00:12:55 [W] Isis and startups would be using a technology like kubernative.
00:13:03 [W] How are they adopted that what challenges might be facing?
00:13:06 [W] And so that's kind of how we got into, you know regarding to thinking about the state of kubernative Africa first and then I'm going to let give it onto tunde to talk about why why did we actually
00:13:18 [W] about the state of kubernative in Africa
00:13:22 [W] All right, so let's get right into your also the why did we stop this stuff?
00:13:32 [W] Why do we thinking of the state of kubermatic is something that everyone should share our is very simple like the red light is like say it says representation matters, right?
00:13:45 [W] One thing that we have to understand is that Africa is the second most populated country in the world continent rather in the world right now we
00:13:52 [W] Understand also that 68% of the population are on that on the file and this 623 sent out a young vibrant people that are adopting technology and because of this companies are moving into Africa.
00:14:07 [W] Kind and by moving to Africa, they are meeting the new set of challenges and despite different from your the North American counterpart. Now how does representation common which representation when every
00:14:23 [W] Showed all the community of the society is represented in a discussion of sort of development.
00:14:39 [W] It's improved quality of our production now kubernative as part of the open source with the integration of representation of dots in a large continent into the development lifecycle.
00:14:46 [W] It's going to help improve. The quality of our production is reached help improve in all the kinds of issue that
00:14:54 [W] that we resolve and also its Helm going to help promote the adoption or the upgrading of talents on the on the continents.
00:15:07 [W] So this is why we think representation matters and why we think the states of kubernative in Africa is a talk that to take cncf and the rest of community should be abolished.
00:15:16 [W] All right.
00:15:20 [W] So now the next thing is let's talk about adoption now adoption.
00:15:24 [W] It's it's a really big theme of research right? We talked to different companies. We talked to are started. We talked to Enterprise.
00:15:38 [W] Now. One thing that we realize is that development teams are trying to build more than application and also it executive are trying to go through digital transformation right there trying to
00:15:45 [W] The tool you are looking for that technology that perfectly and code the process rights and kubernative has proven itself to be a leader in this Arena and therefore Enterprises and
00:16:09 [W] Looking to actually adopt kubernative right now. The question is that what are some of the benefits that are some of the reason why they are looking into adopting kubernative, of course the flexible deployment the
00:16:25 [W] We noticed that a lot of startups kind of point at quick and flexible deployment because as we understand startup environment is a rapidly changing environment.
00:16:41 [W] Therefore, they need a process a to that can undo the quick and flexible deployment process something totally different from the Legacy infrastructure.
00:16:51 [W] Now, let's talk about Enterprises rapid prototyping now Enterprises, are they
00:16:56 [W] I used to the the process of having to go through this long long process of you know, we're bringing out a new future developing a new a new future now the
00:17:11 [W] Something totally different from the Legacy infrastructure. Now, let's talk about Enterprises rapid prototyping now Enterprises are the I used to the the process of
00:17:12 [W] In the can allow them to do rapid prototyping right and gives room for them to actually get fast to get quickly to customers and kubernative has proven itself to be able to Aid in the process of
00:17:26 [W] Now also enterprise Enterprise also emphasize on the concept of cloud Readiness now for this for not America Cloud, maybe 18 off in
00:17:43 [W] 18 Domenica a fish that many companies our country but we have to understand that on the continents many of these companies are trying to understand Cloud that tree to see how can they get ready for and kubernative by migrating to kubernative
00:17:59 [W] Extended step for of forward into that process. Now, let's deal for example a financial institution for a company of that size for called company or with a lot of responsibility of that
00:18:14 [W] I spoke of a company or with a lot of responsibility of that skill break big cloud ready is one of the get-go, but they do not just move into climate Index, right?
00:18:25 [W] They they are thinking of something that can get them is step further into the arena and kubernative provides the advantage now optimization for moving to cloud or moving to kubernative containerization
00:18:37 [W] Enterprise to think about application optimization, how can we improve our application? How can we break down our application from the monolithic, you know architecture into something of service oriented.
00:18:53 [W] So those things are some of the advantages that enterprises really really care about and the discussion of kubernative now scalability now skill ability seems to be something very dear to the heart of
00:19:08 [W] startups that startups are rapidly changing just the way the demographics of their clients is also changing right there want something that can adapt right that can scale with your customer that they can easily
00:19:23 [W] Got expanded it can grow right across cluster for their customer.
00:19:31 [W] So kubernative also offers that the law to startups now the last point right The Entity mttr, like the mean time to resolution for security fixes. We live in
00:19:45 [W] Companies show up on the news quickly, if you know would concerning things like data breaches now for X of Crisis right foot like I mentioned right we're talking about Telco communicate Telco companies of
00:20:00 [W] Things like security is very dear to their heart because it's a call they are corrupt how quickly they can fix this any to that can hate and quit deployment of fixes is what is going to be a favorite for them.
00:20:16 [W] So kubernative kind of fit into the arena, right and then one in a legacy architecture, right? They attracted send out a fixed they have to go through all this long process of you know, sending out security patches, but
00:20:31 [W] It's kubelet is Andre architecture.
00:20:39 [W] They can actually take out the component that needs to be fixed and they can send out right there fixed. So that concludes, you know the adoption by an surprising some of the Enterprise in start-up and
00:20:48 [W] Advantages that is see in kubernative.
00:20:52 [W] So as we've seen the reasons why Enterprises in startups trying to adopt communities, let's look at some of the challenges this Enterprises and startups facing.
00:21:07 [W] As they start to approach kubernative.
00:21:12 [W] The first one today is going to be where to start problem.
00:21:18 [W] And what do we mean by where to start problem?
00:21:20 [W] What we saw was that as Enterprises and startups that it approaching kubernative.
00:21:27 [W] They started asking the questions of where to deploy communities that is should communities be deployed in a cloud environment or s*** is we should this kubernative environment be deployed on premises.
00:21:36 [W] And so help was needed to determine how to navigate this factors.
00:21:43 [W] And then the next one was what shape should the cluster take?
00:21:48 [W] And what do we mean by what what shape should cluster take care and what that means simply is what infrastructure environment should be deployed or configured for kubernative what cloud services should be used?
00:22:04 [W] And at the same time what software should be installed in the environment?
00:22:11 [W] Navigate this factors.
00:22:19 [W] And then the next one was what shape should the cluster take?
00:22:19 [W] And what do we mean by what what shape should cluster take care and what that means simply is what infrastructure environment should be deployed or configured for kubernative what cloud services should be used?
00:22:21 [W] And at the same time what software should be installed in the environment?
00:22:22 [W] Help was needed with navigating these challenges and those are aware necessarily available.
00:22:24 [W] And then the next issue we also see and it's kind of like related to the first two problems is limited expertise.
00:22:29 [W] They were very very limited people with knowledge of kubernative who are able to stand up communities and in on-premises environment or even in a cloud environment, especially for production-ready environment.
00:22:45 [W] And then the next one was application maturity a large number of workloads in the environment that we had interviewed folks when necessarily even containerd ready.
00:23:01 [W] And so it is Legacy application still need to get to the point of maturity before they are able to run on a platform like kubernative.
00:23:07 [W] Another issue that we saw was that people complain about the overwhelming number of tools within the cloud native landscape board. Like if you looked at that board you would see way too many Tools in there right several options for
00:23:24 [W] different categories inside of kubernative for storage for networking and these things are some of the challenges that these Enterprises and startups face because they needed someone was able to help navigate to this tools being
00:23:39 [W] Really even container ready?
00:23:40 [W] And so it is Legacy application still need to get to the point of maturity before they are able to run on a platform like kubernative.
00:23:41 [W] Another issue that we saw was that people complain about the overwhelming number of tools within the cloud native landscape board.
00:23:44 [W] Like if you looked at that board you would see way too many Tools in there right several options for
00:23:44 [W] different categories inside of kubernative for storage for networking and these things are some of the challenges that these Enterprises and startups face because they needed someone was able to help navigate to this tools being
00:23:47 [W] Deshawn of cutting-edge to versus battle-tested to and also being able to evaluate and do a technical assessment on this tools.
00:23:50 [W] And the last one was maturity of managed community service due to the limited expertise that is available within the within within the landscape.
00:24:02 [W] most Enterprises and startup seem to lean on or once managed Services because
00:24:11 [W] managed Services provides support for this environment and that way they feel like they can get enabled and they don't need to start from scratch, but the problem was that
00:24:24 [W] Up until recently managed services are now becoming more more and more mature.
00:24:37 [W] And so now we're starting to see that.
00:24:38 [W] Okay.
00:24:39 [W] This might not be much more of a challenge.
00:24:47 [W] But this was a previous challenge to most of the startups and Enterprises that we had spoken to and that concludes the challenges and that we saw with Enterprises and startups that
00:24:55 [W] To seize and now becoming more more and more mature and so now we're starting to see that.
00:24:57 [W] Okay.
00:24:59 [W] This might not be much more of a challenge. But this was a previous challenge to most of the startups and Enterprises that we had spoken to and that concludes the challenges and that we saw with
00:25:00 [W] So the next thing is community growth.
00:25:03 [W] and this is how
00:25:06 [W] And what is actually influencing the growth of the k8s community in Africa?
00:25:18 [W] And then the first thing you are as availability of land and resources what we learned from folks that we had interviewed was that the communities that I you documentation has really paved the way for folks who are trying to get that every communities.
00:25:30 [W] the the amount of information in that documentation and the standards that have been set by the kubenetes docs team as kind of like really significantly helped folks
00:25:45 [W] For folks who are trying to get that every community's the the amount of information in that documentation and the standards that have been set by the kubenetes docs team
00:25:46 [W] bordered on the kubernative project
00:25:48 [W] and then the next one is cncf sponsorship and scholarship the cncf sponsorship of candidates in Africa to be able to go into OSS conferences and take the lessons learned from those presentations at those conferences
00:26:04 [W] video back into their own environment or to the air horn respective startups and Enterprises and share in this case studies with your fellow colleagues as significantly impacted Community root, and then also
00:26:19 [W] Have diversity scholarships and also provided huge opportunities to folks in Africa along with some of the other cncf scholarship, but also our scholarships to take sets of equations like the set of five kubernative administrator
00:26:35 [W] also helps individuals who are trying to show their proficiency with kubernative which currently is a huge deal because there are limited limited people who are able to show their expertise
00:26:50 [W] is in the African landscape and now this poses a lot of opportunity for a lot of people because
00:26:57 [W] To take the certification for kubernetes is quite expensive at least from Dallas what we learned from from the people we interviewed that.
00:27:07 [W] That this educational experience Eve and they cncf scholarship really significantly else and then local Miko's what we're seeing is that now start ups in auto companies devops devops.
00:27:22 [W] Folks and even go meet ups have been spun up right startups are coming out to local meetups to talk about your joining with cabinets and talk about how they're driving games with kubernative.
00:27:37 [W] The impact given X is happening with you within their environment.
00:27:37 [W] And then it makes one is sausage stories.
00:27:47 [W] We're seeing that enterprises and startups are writing blogs.
00:27:48 [W] There is a specific example given about an e-commerce company who had written a Blog about how they had migrated into using kubernative without downtime and at the same time seeing significant Improvement and
00:28:02 [W] There's a specific example giving about an e-commerce company who had written a Blog about how they had migrated into using kubernative without downtime and at the same time seeing significant Improvement and
00:28:04 [W] from their customers
00:28:05 [W] and then the last one is option kubernative contributions were started to see you much more folks from various parts of Africa coming in the communities Upstream environment to make contributions
00:28:21 [W] these people are taking their Landings into your their various communities communities and talking about what's going on in those Upstream contributions and Saudis all these are kind of like we're seeing
00:28:37 [W] Ugly signaling to the various folks inside of like, you know the devops SRE go and even infra space in Africa.
00:28:54 [W] So that all right. So I mean my cool speaker talked about, you know things that has really boosted the community growth and all these you know, many of these high impact by f word from cncf variety.
00:29:09 [W] I mean my cool speaker talked about, you know teams that has really boosted the community growth and all these you know, many of these high impact by effort from cncf provided documentation and the kubernative community
00:29:13 [W] And it kubernative Community.
00:29:18 [W] This effort has led to some group or well I thought we spoke to Coco people in the community. They are something like challenges right?
00:29:23 [W] There is some limiting factors, you know about around the community number one is a limited experience. He's now expertise goes beyond reading documentation.
00:29:32 [W] It requires like Anton, you know operation right many of us can agree that in a we get most of our experience from doing right now. There's
00:29:40 [W] is only a few of those people that have truly truly Innovative interested and you know trust and in production, right because the limited expertise right?
00:29:55 [W] A lot of companies are having challenges right getting the right people for the job right now because of that those are some of the things our companies are factoring into their communities German, right and also
00:30:06 [W] Production right because of the limited expertise right? A lot of companies are having challenges right getting the right people for the job right now because of that those are some of the things
00:30:08 [W] And step can be deduced from the expertise is that many of them brought some of the the skimming the Aldi the question about mentorship right Mentor. She is very critical in
00:30:22 [W] From people that were spoken to they wanted someone that done this in prison so that he can talk to someone outside, you know Google stock overflow.
00:30:34 [W] He Toby should I cannot dress, you know talk about production challenges to what because of the limited number of experts around right? It has really constrained our well the knowledge of the community groups right now the last part
00:30:47 [W] People were quite passionate about cncf product cncf to know tools kubernative cloudevents him landscape right now those that they are willing to go beyond to actually tell people about
00:31:03 [W] Feet of migrating into the cloud knative architecture, but they are the most of these most of this advertisement like, you know, most of these events have been having organized from our pocket because of
00:31:19 [W] Some event had been having organized from out of pocket because of that limit the amount of things that it can provide limit the amount of resource. They can provide, you know in limit Alpha
00:31:28 [W] It limits the amount of resource. They can provide, you know in limit alpha alpha they can reach out in on those challenges.
00:31:37 [W] So those are the three main things that we notice in the community the limit limited expertise the words lack of in a mentorship and also the limited funding to always events that boast the community groups.
00:31:47 [W] Now, I guess you know the follow-up then is alkanes cncf cncf has been very instrumental in the growth of the community.
00:31:59 [W] We can all agree on that. They have provided resources remarkably right cncf Linux Foundation. You have provided a resource remarkable remarkable resource, but we notice that cocoa areas are still lacking
00:32:14 [W] Dial in the growth of the community. We can all agree on that. They have provided resources remarkably right cncf Linux Foundation. You have provided a resource remarkable remarkable resource, but we notice that
00:32:16 [W] I will be ambassadors ambassador's I like, you know, very positive result of knowledge right experience. And also advocacy now the provide the bring the community together they make our realness they create
00:32:29 [W] Well, we realized that the number of ambassadors around African communities quite limited, right?
00:32:42 [W] So now cncf can actually help with growth of the community by bringing more ambassadors into the African cloudevents Cape.
00:32:52 [W] It's going to help break in experienced folks.
00:32:57 [W] Well backed by good resource to talk about the benefits of kubernative. So componentconfig.
00:33:00 [W] Peonies and also not just a company like my co-speaker mention engineer's have a lot of battles to fight.
00:33:15 [W] They have to lend it technology know the benefit and also convinced the executive on the importance of the co-opting the to of the cloud native tool but if cncf ambassadors rights also
00:33:23 [W] Also provide knowledge, you know outside guidance to react to this executive it helps improves the rates of adoption in the community.
00:33:37 [W] Now the next point the sponsorship of local community, like I mentioned before many of those events that we see organized how usually organized out of pockets because of the constraints of resource many of these
00:33:49 [W] Cannot do as much as they can write write as much as they should do as much as the community needs, but with this with more sponsorship from cncf, right?
00:34:05 [W] We are going to see rapid growth of in our knowledge. Like there's good to be more despairs of knowledge around the community the roadmap inclusion.
00:34:16 [W] A lot of companies are moving into Africa, right? And one thing that we can all agree. Is that buildpacks?
00:34:20 [W] Different environments sometimes post different Tech constraints or taking a challenge because of the sound science companies in Africa having unique set of challenge.
00:34:34 [W] That's my not be included in kubernative roadmap or not.
00:34:39 [W] not. Just kubernative some of these open source roadmap right now if we can think about this this, you know billion set of users if we can think about them and
00:34:50 [W] Different category of meat and included a road map. It can actually help a lot of companies to actually adopt kubernative faster, right?
00:35:04 [W] So those roadmap inclusion like we all know like all the inclusion helps Foster rapid adoption of that technology, right number one one reductive scholarship.
00:35:16 [W] Yeah, that's kubelet Saab cncf has really really shown, you know good efforts because you know from attending huge con previous Cube coin. We have met people who have been a major benefit from
00:35:32 [W] From Africa, right, but we believe in a without availability of more scholarship.
00:35:40 [W] It's going to allow more people to pursue a passion or to learn more or to meet other thoughts leaders right in the climate of landscape, which is going to help them to forge without understanding and
00:35:54 [W] Help them to navigate how they can impact this knowledge to others.
00:36:06 [W] Now. The finally one major thing right that we think can actually help for styra expansion massively is a potential coupon in Africa now more advantage of
00:36:15 [W] Brings together the technical aspect the non-technical aspects and try to make them understand each other now engineer is right. They can read the documentation and understand what is going on what business executive right?
00:36:30 [W] These this Excel could see the totally does meeting other thoughts leader vitess allows for communication allow for discussion about the benefits of communities when this executive well distorts leader
00:36:46 [W] Meet other like Minds it allows for growth and expansion. Just beyond tekton Community even in two different seasons, right?
00:37:02 [W] So we believe these are some of the ways that cncf and help cncf at the doudna very good job of the, you know, expanding promoting the community, but we think with this implementation of this extra resource.
00:37:13 [W] Right. So we believe these are some of the ways that cncf and help cncf at the doing a very good job of the you know, expanding promoting the community but we think with this implementation of this extra
00:37:15 [W] for that expansion of Calamity of landscape in Africa
00:37:20 [W] and
00:37:24 [W] one of the other things we wanted to cover was, how can you help?
00:37:30 [W] and you know, the first one of the first ways is
00:37:37 [W] collaborating with folks in Africa collaborating with folks in the landscape, you know reaching out to folks in meetups setting up virtual virtual meetups You Know Rich helping out
00:37:53 [W] Reaching out in the kids Community, you know with need for advocacy, right, you know volunteering to speak at events in Africa.
00:38:09 [W] So one of the things that we saw was a huge Need For Thought advocacy right someone who could
00:38:16 [W] Help in you know driving those thoughts into at least into the leaders into into those who are employing this tools those who are considering employing communities within their environment.
00:38:32 [W] Tools that are going to even run on top of kubernative.
00:38:38 [W] So this is this were some of the other ways that we think that folks could help if anything like with the with everything that is happening 2020. I think it's open up more opportunities for
00:38:54 [W] and so if folks can reach out you can reach out to on maybe just go on meetup.com and look up, you know meetups in Africa focused on you know, things like kubenetes Cloud native meetups
00:39:09 [W] You know or even visit visit the could potentially also visited Africa to do a presentation on site.
00:39:20 [W] So just being open to people, you know, being being available to provide mentorship to folks that that are reaching out and even
00:39:32 [W] If you're not able to provide mentorship to them, you can also you know, you can refer them to someone we think there might be able to help them with whatever they're trying to lend. You are whatever they need mentorship on
00:39:49 [W] To talk for the day.
00:39:51 [W] But before I let you go, I want to shout on the number of people who contributed to this talk.
00:39:58 [W] First one being Martin Umbra to nauseam Pomo R eally and femi and then a number of Enterprises and startups would also share their experiences as they
00:40:14 [W] They are Cloud native Johnny.
00:40:17 [W] And feel free if you have any questions for us, feel free to find me.
00:40:24 [W] That's getting me and my co-speaker.
00:40:30 [W] Are you can also find me at I am Simplicity on Twitter right? Unlike like my post to customization, you know, these people what we thought it worked a lot with us the start of the Enterprise and also individuals and give us their
00:40:46 [W] On Twitter right unlike like my post because mention, you know, these people what we thought it worked a lot with us.
00:40:48 [W] Let's start up the Enterprise and also individuals give us their personal experience.
00:40:49 [W] So we really thank you for this work.

00:42:59 [W] There was a there's a really interesting question in the air.
00:42:59 [W] by someone in the chat and I just posted that and so the question is checking and
00:43:10 [W] driving adoption of cloud knative among companies in Africa or building of existing developer operation of talent and Africa for the global market, its kind of outside, you know, maybe kubernative adoption, but
00:43:27 [W] Of like bring it to to what we're talking about you I think I won't get to both.
00:43:36 [W] If we invest in talent and Africa the same time company were technically invested in companies in Africa. Also in order to in order for those companies to be able to achieve their goals. They need college and so we
00:43:52 [W] The talents of self and then from there we segue into those companies. So it's kind of like use it once don't kill to a bit here.
