00:13:30 [W] So I'm going to pass it over to intros.
00:13:34 [W] So who we are and what we do.
00:13:36 [W] I'll kick it off and then we'll go through the rest of the team.
00:13:37 [W] Here is all joining us. So my name is Lachlan evensen. I work for Microsoft as a principal engineer at Microsoft and I've been on steering for the last few months and in the last few months, we've been working hard and I'm excited to share everything with we've been doing

00:13:57 [W] Find me at number 7 there lucky 83 on kubernative slack if you want to chat. I will pass it to Kristoff.
00:14:00 [W] Quiet everyone.
00:14:06 [W] My name is Christoph blocher.
00:14:08 [W] I work for Red Hat doing site reliability engineering work.
00:14:15 [W] I'm also a technical lead for the contributor experience special interest group, and I'm based out of British Columbia Canada.
00:14:22 [W] I'll pass it over to Derek.
00:14:23 [W] Hey everyone, I'm Derek.
00:14:29 [W] I also work at Red Hat.
00:14:30 [W] I'm at this thing's engineer working in product engineering also been serving now.
00:14:40 [W] I guess my third year in the steering and it's been fun. And it's always a pleasure to meet both virtually and in person here and with that I will pass it on to dims.
00:14:48 [W] Yeah me I work for VMware.
00:14:55 [W] I live in Boston and I help out with sagada picture and a few other things cross-cutting six as well. I'll pass it on to Nikita.
00:15:03 [W] Everyone, I'm Nikita.
00:15:08 [W] I'm in India and I work at VMware with gems and a code technical lead for Sig contribute experience with Kristoff with that Paris.
00:15:19 [W] And I think I think we ended here.
00:15:23 [W] Hi everyone.
00:15:25 [W] I'm Parris. I work at Apple.
00:15:26 [W] This is my first year on steering. I think we're first completed year, and I'm just so happy to be here.
00:15:35 [W] I miss everybody.
00:15:40 [W] I wish we were on site right now, but we're still happy to be here.
00:15:42 [W] And lucky I think that's it.
00:15:49 [W] Yes, do we miss our own as well?
00:15:53 [W] It's fine.
00:15:59 [W] I know I wasn't at the last Cube.
00:16:00 [W] Konso. Hi, I'm Aaron Kirk and burger.
00:16:05 [W] This is also my third year on steering.
00:16:09 [W] I'm a chair of Sig testing.
00:16:16 [W] I served as the 114 release lead and I'm organizing the Kate's in for working group alongside dims and parts pecola excited to be here Lockheed back to you.
00:16:23 [W] And I'm going to quickly pass it back to Nikita.
00:16:27 [W] I already did the intro, but I can do it again.
00:16:37 [W] So I'm all the way in India work with them sit. We over and record technical lead with Kristoff on contributor experience.
00:16:44 [W] Wonderful.
00:16:49 [W] Wonderful.
00:16:49 [W] Wonderful.
00:16:50 [W] Wonderful. Thank you so much. And sorry about that. I had trouble keeping track, but that's ok. It's ok to intros are better than none.
00:16:56 [W] Who we are and what we do is I'm going to pass it back to dims dims take it away.
00:17:02 [W] We are here for cloud native con que con.
00:17:10 [W] So we are technically, you know, Linux foundation cncf and then the kubenetes project comes under cncf and we are essentially the steering committee is the One-Stop shop for everything related
00:17:24 [W] When it comes to the legal structure and organization and stuff like that.
00:17:34 [W] So we have Liaisons to cncf we request funding we work with them around trademarks and copyrights and a whole bunch of other things. So back back to you lucky.
00:17:42 [W] Thanks. Tim's and next we're going to hand it to Derek who's going to show us a little bit about the organizational structure of kubernative.
00:17:51 [W] There's a project.
00:17:52 [W] I'll pass it to you Derek.
00:17:53 [W] things like so kubenetes is a grown to be a very big project now about five or six years into its life cycle and So within steering what we largely do is look to provide project-wide governance, but
00:18:09 [W] I'll pass it to you Derek.
00:18:09 [W] things like so communities is a grown to be a very big project now about five or six years into its life cycle and So within steering what we largely do is look to provide project-wide governance, but
00:18:11 [W] Delegate decision-making to local interest groups as much as possible.
00:18:18 [W] So the overall structure of interest groups both domain-specific and horizontal are largely overseen by the steering committee and then issues related to project-wide governance policies like code of conduct. Excetera
00:18:31 [W] largely driven out of steering or delegated to appropriate subcommittee many folks when they interact with kubernative actually never need to interact with steering and that's actually a sign that I think we're doing a pretty good job in many cases
00:18:47 [W] It appropriately so many folks you engage with the project might engage with a particular sub project like the scheduler the cubelet or API machinery and each of these sub projects tend to get sponsored by higher order special interest group
00:19:02 [W] projects tend to get sponsored by higher order special interest group and special interest groups would be things like no door where you have a very demand specific interest or you have horizontal
00:19:12 [W] um, we have a very demand specific interest or you have horizontal groups who kind of keep the cross project structure Wheels going things like architecture release, but within steering we're here to try
00:19:22 [W] But within steering we're here to try to make sure that we can adjust the project structure to meet the present needs.
00:19:34 [W] And if you do find yourself needing to engage with us, we're always happy to help learn and adjust them what we can do better in the community.
00:19:37 [W] I will pass it back to you lucky.
00:19:41 [W] Thank you Derrick. So we did actually place the link. You can see it there at the bottom. If you want to reference that diagram. It's a great diagram to print out and have on your wall as you're interacting with the kubernative community so you can find the right place to engage for whatever you need or whatever way you like to contribute.
00:19:58 [W] Next we're going to move to Nikita and we have a few items that we've been working on the past few months.
00:20:09 [W] So Nikita is going to give us an update there.
00:20:11 [W] I'll pass it to Nikita.
00:20:13 [W] Hey, so we've been working on a bunch of cool stuff.
00:20:19 [W] So one big change that we've rolled out last month was requiring unconscious bias training for all Sig chairs. And technically, it's we understand that a 30 minute trading isn't going to eliminate vitess.
00:20:29 [W] Completely, but we hope that this is going to be a first step towards at least identifying the language is and behaviors that could be problematic for Perforating. The
00:20:44 [W] Understand that a third human a trading isn't going to eliminate bias completely but we hope that this is going to be a first step towards at least identifying the languages and behaviors that could be problematic for
00:20:46 [W] We work on is running the code of conduct committee election. So we did that this month and congratulations to Karent them and Celeste for winning the election and joining the committee and that big thanks to Trey has Jennifer and Carolyn for all the time.
00:21:00 [W] Gotta find it committee. One of my really favorite things that we've been working on is the steering committee liaison, certainly each community group like six working groups and user groups are assigned a steering committee point of contact
00:21:16 [W] Act is used to like for everything and they basically act as a mean feedback loop for maintaining the group's health and could be used for something like reshaping project priority is identifying.
00:21:32 [W] You guys and celebrating wins.
00:21:41 [W] We also have something very cool about annual reports. But Palace is going to go into detail about that after this something else if we'd be looking into is improving our steering meeting structure to make sure that we're using
00:21:50 [W] The raise hand feature and zoom timeboxing discussions and making sure we don't really have that loudest voice in the room kind of thing.
00:22:03 [W] So yeah, these are some of the cool things that we've been doing these days and back to you lucky.
00:22:09 [W] Thanks Nikita. As you can see, you know, we're very active in the community taking steps to help grow at so thank you for sharing that with everybody in Akita.
00:22:18 [W] Excellent. Next we're going to move on an errand is going to share a lot about cigs and the scope of the project. So I'll pass it to Aaron.
00:22:25 [W] Thank you.
00:22:26 [W] hey, they gave me the
00:22:34 [W] non-hierarchical it sort of made up of a bunch of non hierarchical groups.
00:22:47 [W] There are many different areas you within which you can contribute we try to have some sense of organization not all groups are the same some of them focus on deep verticals like, you know node or networking or storage whereas
00:22:59 [W] Horizontal across the project cross-cutting concerns like API Machinery or multi cluster and then you have things that are more trying to set project policy like architecture release or testing or contributor experience
00:23:16 [W] Hips are things that sort of span multiple six and then committees as Eric pointed out earlier our points of escalation.
00:23:30 [W] So the other important Point here is for every single one of these boxes.
00:23:35 [W] There are about two or three people who would be happy to chat with you about what's going on in that area of the project back to you lucky.
00:23:40 [W] Excellent.
00:23:44 [W] Thank you Aaron.
00:23:48 [W] And so as you can see the project is massive and scales out.
00:23:50 [W] There are many different functions inside the kubernative project committees cigs working groups.
00:24:03 [W] So in order to actually manage the scaling and making sure that all those different parts of the communities project to manage well and taken care of we're actually introduced annual products, which are Paris is going to take us through over to you.
00:24:08 [W] Hi everyone. So this year one of the major initiatives that we've been working on is annual reports as Aaron showed you with that diagram.
00:24:21 [W] We have 37 groups.
00:24:24 [W] That is a ton to keep up with.
00:24:27 [W] We also have a monthly community meeting where our groups have been giving ten minute updates, but after after a while things start to accumulate and updates become a massive and our end users are wondering how they can find out information about
00:24:39 [W] Out individual groups on a certain Cadence.
00:24:45 [W] Projects that Braun very large scale distributed groups like we do have very similar structures as well.
00:25:01 [W] And this will actually unfold for most special interest groups in January of twenty Twenty-One.
00:25:08 [W] We're actually rolling it out right now as we speak to our working groups because our working groups are a little bit more temporary in nature anyway, so it makes sense to kind of roll things out with them first.
00:25:15 [W] working out some of the process
00:25:18 [W] is there with them to we actually have already had two working groups that are about to kind of roll down and think about what their role down process looks like now that we've kind of engaged with them to see you know, what their Community needs are
00:25:31 [W] She ended the liaison bit is a big part of this because we're really trying to make further connections within our ever-growing community and as things spread wider and wider.
00:25:47 [W] It's really important for us to just hone in on what's working.
00:25:52 [W] And what's not and some of these groups and really help out in a more proactive fashion, but that's about it lucky back to you.
00:25:59 [W] Thank you Paris.
00:26:04 [W] Now a Hot Topic that's happening in the community right now.
00:26:07 [W] We're going to have kristov take us through a steering committee elections. I'll possibly Kristoff.
00:26:11 [W] So the seven of us here were all elected out of the community to steering.
00:26:29 [W] We had a couple years ago a bootstrap process that kind of kicked off and as we developed and figured out how to govern a project the size of kubernative.
00:26:35 [W] So at this point all seven of us are actually elected from the community to to have a seat on steering and to contribute our voices to to the discussions and such that we were
00:26:43 [W] Talking about the election process for 2020 has actually kicked off kicked off about a week ago or so.
00:26:53 [W] Go to to nominate somebody or self-nominate to to run on the for the career center in committee. What the criteria is to be able to vote this nomination period closes on September the 8th
00:27:18 [W] In mid-september around the 14th or so the ballots will end up going out for this year's election.
00:27:32 [W] So if you're interested in learning either how to nominate somebody or checking if you're eligible to vote in this year's election, please check out those links Allah. Keep back to you.
00:27:37 [W] Thank you kristov.
00:27:45 [W] So I'm just going to go through how you can connect with steering.
00:27:50 [W] So we have a couple of different forums. If you're in the kubernetes slack, there is the steering - committee Channel P. Please feel free to go over there and ask any questions you have of us or if steering we monitor that channel, so thank you mailing
00:28:00 [W] Lucky back to you.
00:28:00 [W] Thank you kristov.
00:28:01 [W] So I'm just going to go through how you can connect with steering.
00:28:01 [W] So we have a couple of different forums. If you're in the kubernative slack, there is the steering - committee Channel P. Please feel free to go over there and ask any questions you have of us or if steering we monitor that channel, so thank you mailing
00:28:03 [W] A public and a private mailing list for conversations to start or different things that you might want to raise with steering and then we have meetings. So we have public meetings in the first Monday at 11 a.m.
00:28:16 [W] Us Pacific time. You are welcome to join we publish an agenda there. If you have any items you'd like to add to that agenda. Please feel free and we'll slip them into subsequent meetings.
00:28:26 [W] We also publish a YouTube playlist as well from all past meetings. So if you have a topic that you're interested to learn
00:28:32 [W] learn more about or did how decisions were made all those decisions are posted publicly on the YouTube playlist.
00:28:40 [W] I will find a link to that and you can obviously file an issue Upstream using the kubernative steering GitHub repository.
00:28:52 [W] So they are just different when two ways you can interact with us, and obviously we're all around as well as individuals if you want to find us on kubernative slack, so we'd encourage you to come talk to us and we'd love to connect you into the kubernative community and hear from how the
00:29:01 [W] Is working with and for you so they are different ways. You can find us now.
00:29:06 [W] We're going to move over to a time of am a so I'm again going to ask that people are enter questions in the Q&A box.
00:29:20 [W] box. So any questions that you might have about anything you just learn or anything about the kubernative community whether you're a longtime contributor or a brand-new computer view that we'd love to answer your questions, and we also have in the maintainer channel of the cube Connie.
00:29:31 [W] Monitoring as well.
00:29:37 [W] So we're going to put everybody up on screen and I have a question here already. So we should see everybody role in wonderful.
00:29:43 [W] You can see all of us fantastic.
00:29:45 [W] Okay, excellent.
00:29:50 [W] So I'm going to read out question we have here.
00:29:50 [W] Hello. Okay, what do you know now that you didn't know when you started on the steering committee?
00:29:58 [W] And what advice do you give people based on what you've learned?
00:30:02 [W] Anybody like to dive in go go ahead Aaron and then power our Parish.
00:30:22 [W] So I so I is is is people first and foremost.
00:30:26 [W] introduced to the project just sort of trying to contribute code and make things better that way but I very quickly realized that there are a bunch of people who care very deeply about what we do and
00:30:37 [W] We do it and that in order to effectively get real things accomplished involved Better or For Worse talking to people but it turned out to be not such a
00:30:52 [W] I think being able to interact with the community really quickly slack or asynchronously get discuss or you know, having a chat on issues or pull requests was incredibly
00:31:08 [W] You know having a chat on issues or pull requests was incredibly helpful.
00:31:17 [W] And so although sometimes it was really intimidating the level of scrutiny my code might get or the level of feedback my questions for change might receive.
00:31:23 [W] I quickly realized it all came from a place of people caring and the most important thing to do was to figure out how could we like make incremental progress?
00:31:32 [W] Progress and move forward and yeah, that's that's the advice that I would give extra stuff. Thank you.
00:31:45 [W] Yep, go ahead Paris.
00:31:50 [W] I was going to say that not everything that comes to steering needs an answer right away.
00:31:57 [W] I'm coming from a community back Community manager background and I'm very used to giving or finding Solutions very quickly some of the problems that come to us are a little bit more ambiguous and nature.
00:32:10 [W] Sure, that's why you're coming to us.
00:32:16 [W] And I think that asking for context and getting more context and doing more digging because actually very much required for this position.
00:32:25 [W] And I think that like my listening skills to have also have also you don't want to say improve but I mean that feel like they also have improved as well because when you take when you take different types of
00:32:36 [W] Sessions. I feel like listening is like one of the first and foremost skills that that you should have and try to strive to be better with and I've definitely I feel like have been working on that
00:32:52 [W] Dear, so, I think that not everything needs to have an answer right away and listening are two takeaways for me.
00:33:05 [W] Thank you.
00:33:11 [W] Parishad Derek headings and dimms. Are you okay laughter laughter and don't need her as well as comments field near me. I would strongly Echo with Paris just said like
00:33:22 [W] Steering. I think there's a lot of
00:33:25 [W] maybe different perceptions on what the role is versus the reality and I think the key thing with role like steering is it's a position and a body that has a lot of power and like all power.
00:33:42 [W] It's best used responsibly and that key importance on like acting responsibly requires like not necessarily the greatest rate. And so sometimes I think even within the steering committee and this is kind of like the seccomp.
00:33:56 [W] Can't and a half steering body.
00:34:02 [W] I've served with like partly with the bootstrap and then you election.
00:34:06 [W] We often look back and question.
00:34:07 [W] What what accomplish what do we get done?
00:34:21 [W] And sometimes there's ways you can look at that and say like, oh, well, we could have done so much more but I think there's actually value to like changes happening at our great got a community of
00:34:24 [W] Just and not causing rapid Sharon just to keep stability in place.
00:34:38 [W] And so we deal with a lot of people who engage with kubernetes on a part-time basis as well as a full-time basis and like making massive changes around how a project is structured action hamper that engagement and
00:34:44 [W] To me like I'm most proud where we can make small subtle tweaks and steering that can have large impacts and I would say like the experience last three years and has shown that that's what's been most surprising to me.
00:35:00 [W] dive in Decatur
00:35:06 [W] Yeah, I was just going to say that when I joined steering. I wasn't aware of like I knew that there were going to be ambiguous problems to solve but I wasn't aware how like the range of our biggest problems that would need to be solved like it's not
00:35:22 [W] Solution of process-oriented as identified like publicly public relations or marketing also that I've learned here.
00:35:37 [W] So I think one piece of advice that I'd have to understand what kind of problems that we need to be solving is also just attend public steering committee meetings that we have to get an idea of what we are solving how we solve it and what
00:35:45 [W] Suddenly, it's me. Solving is not suggested and public steering committee meetings that we have to get an idea of what we are solving how we solve it and what goes on.
00:35:48 [W] Go for a dent.
00:35:55 [W] I think Derek colored with the points that I was going to make but I just want to add a little bit color to it.
00:36:00 [W] So we have a position in this committee.
00:36:06 [W] We have a lot of power.
00:36:11 [W] Uh sure and we can we need to make sure that we use it wisely and best not to use it. Especially when it comes to the people that we are governing as well as the things that we can do in the
00:36:22 [W] larger ecosystem kubernative easy extremely important
00:36:27 [W] project right now.
00:36:37 [W] So we have to keep it going and we have to figure out ways to make sure that we can use the long tail of people.
00:36:38 [W] what are helping out and make sure that they are able to
00:36:42 [W] Help make changes to kubenetes and keep that going the other one that I wanted to poke at was we are constantly evolving, right?
00:36:58 [W] So and we have the ability the steering committee has the ability to make changes in how the community Works how we interact with cncf and whatnot.
00:37:07 [W] So there's a lot of context and history that we should understand or try to understand. So we always rely on people who have been in stating before and who are currently serving.
00:37:13 [W] out and make sure that they are able to
00:37:16 [W] Help make changes to kubenetes and keep that going the other one that I wanted to poke at was we are constantly evolving, right?
00:37:17 [W] So and we have the ability the steering committee has the ability to make changes in how the community Works how we interact with cncf and whatnot.
00:37:19 [W] So there's a lot of context and history that we should understand or try to understand. So we always rely on people who have been in stating before and who are currently serving.
00:37:21 [W] But you know have more contacts. So we try to learn you know, what what happened how it happened why it happened and try to understand the background of the problem.
00:37:24 [W] Well before like move fast and break things kind of approach. So the incremental progress like direct said is definitely an important part of it as well back to you
00:37:37 [W] What happened how it happened?
00:37:37 [W] Why it happened and try to understand the background of the problem. Well before like move fast and break things kind of approach. So the incremental progress like direct said is definitely an important part of it as well
00:37:39 [W] Did everyone I have an opportunity to answer think we're okay.
00:37:45 [W] I was the old friend Christopher.
00:37:47 [W] I'm sorry one that I want to add though is something I didn't know or realize prior to joining steering so prior
00:38:01 [W] I've been involved with a lot of horizontal sings and working groups and things like contributor experience and testing and attending Sig architecture meetings and things like that.
00:38:17 [W] Those are some great ways to follow like bigger picture ideas that are going on the project but prior to steering and really like digging into the breadth and width of the the kubernative project. There is
00:38:29 [W] Going on and it is hard to keep track of it. All the thing that I learned there is just like the where there's so much real work being done in all these little sub projects all over that are incrementally making the project.
00:38:44 [W] Moving it along just inches at a time and we have to move it those little small incremental pieces along in small incremental pieces because it's such a large project.
00:38:57 [W] That's that's that's moving.
00:39:03 [W] There's trying to move forward and trying to move forward in a way that is not going to break folks, but try and continue to bring value to what cork kubernetes is and yeah, you don't
00:39:12 [W] Lino unless you kind of go out and seek and and you know, so the thing that I would advice that I would give is maybe attend a meeting that you wouldn't normally attend like go check out a Sig that you haven't you
00:39:28 [W] You wouldn't normally attend like go check out a Sig that you haven't you haven't checked out before even if it's not something that is very obviously on the surface interesting to you.
00:39:38 [W] There's probably some really cool things happening that that you didn't that you didn't know about and it's a great way to learn about all the different things for going on the project.
00:39:44 [W] Excellent.
00:39:50 [W] Thank you all we have another question here.
00:39:54 [W] What had the biggest challenge has been for steering in 2020?
00:39:55 [W] Well, there's a couple fairly obvious ones.
00:40:08 [W] for example moving to entirely virtual and missing out on some of the like in person meetings and sessions and collaboration that we would normally have,
00:40:21 [W] Most of the time like kubernative being a global Community.
00:40:32 [W] We're fairly remote most of the time anyways, and we're collaborating with folks all over the world.
00:40:39 [W] So in some in some ways things haven't changed but also it's still has made a big impact like, you know, whether or not it's changed your day-to-day.
00:40:47 [W] It's made kind of this impact on everybody being able to like have the headspace even to be able to like, okay I need
00:40:52 [W] Like go to meetings I need to to to still do PR.
00:41:02 [W] It's like I still need to like do do all these things as our lives have been changing around us outside of the specific things that we might do with Cooper and he's and, you know even doing the session like I miss
00:41:12 [W] Your for the opportunity for when we get to kind of come back together and be able to work in person because you know, there's some things that you just can't necessarily do virtually so that to me is like one of the biggest most obvious problems that we've
00:41:27 [W] Taco with Syrian and figure out you know, what are tweaks we need to make in the in the community like, you know at one point we sent out a message saying hey if you need to like cancel or postpone or right change your
00:41:43 [W] Okay, like adapt to what our contributors end up beating as opposed to forcing everybody into a rigid schedule of okay, you still need to have your meetings in a you know, a perfect Cadence and such.
00:41:58 [W] I think I saw Derek.
00:42:06 [W] I'll pass it to Derrick and then I saw it dims as hand-to-hand Tech.
00:42:18 [W] Yeah, I would say like I feel it's important here as the steering committee body like to say that the challenges that everyone feels we feel and so I think Christoph did a great way of communicating that to me.
00:42:22 [W] think the biggest challenge in the biggest growth I've seen in Cuba as a project this year is just kind of
00:42:30 [W] I've noticed that we become more empathetic towards each other like we all feel like we're living through a uniquely interesting time even as I'm speaking here.
00:42:43 [W] I was joking with our colleagues that my daughter's might come rushing in at any moment during this presentation and that would be both cool and weird at the same time. So I think in general it's been healthy that as the product matures. We also kind of
00:42:52 [W] Our empathy towards our contributors in our peers who may have less time and energy to invest and they might have normally and that gives opportunity and space for new fresh blood to infuse the
00:43:08 [W] Base for new fresh blood to infuse the project with new ideas and energy so I actually think it's been a challenge in a blessing and for those who are wanting to engage like try to see if you can find gaps
00:43:18 [W] Then I challenge in a blessing and for those who are wanting to engage like try to see if you can find gaps to fill and this is a great time to ask somebody.
00:43:24 [W] Hey, what can I do to help out because everybody are going to meet the present needs.
00:43:28 [W] So one thing that I don't know if people feel or not we have to listen a lot we have to listen to people in the community.
00:43:43 [W] We are to listen to people outside our community.
00:43:46 [W] We listen to what's happening in the news traitor anything related kubernative.
00:43:51 [W] We try to talk about it.
00:43:55 [W] We try to analyze what's happening where and why and is there something we can do when you say things like okay some say
00:43:59 [W] Is not very responsive or some PRS are not getting much. Some owners files are not up-to-date. So there is a problem.
00:44:09 [W] So all the problems that you can think of we do think about them.
00:44:23 [W] So it's it's how much we can do what we can do and when we can do governs, you know, so if you feel that we are not listening, please believe me.
00:44:28 [W] We are trying and please do bring it to our notice.
00:44:29 [W] Even if you're not able to do something about it right away, we will try to make sure that we put it we put enough thought into it as a team and get back to you one way or another and and try to make progress over a period of time.
00:44:44 [W] back to you lucky
00:44:50 [W] Thank you very much.
00:44:53 [W] Did anybody else want to respond to this question?
00:44:56 [W] Okay, we have one more question here.
00:45:02 [W] And I think that will round out our time.
00:45:05 [W] What do you see as the biggest challenges for kubernative going forward?
00:45:08 [W] Did you want to Paris or Nikita?
00:45:12 [W] Nikita take it - Nikita.
00:45:21 [W] Yeah, I think sustainability is the biggest one. We have the problem about not having enough to be not having enough approvals.
00:45:34 [W] - Nikita.
00:45:34 [W] Yeah, I think sustainability is the biggest one. We have the problem about not having enough to be not having enough approvers and
00:45:36 [W] So not having enough responsive approvers.
00:45:43 [W] It's like a very big challenge for us. And also our project is very skewed towards people who can contribute full-time over part time. So I think figuring out a process where we can enable people who even work part-time or just can contribute
00:45:52 [W] Thread, but week is something we need to figure out we're trying to work towards that but I think we still need to do a lot of work to get that rolling.
00:46:03 [W] Paris first one in true kubernative fashion looks good to me Aaron
00:46:23 [W] Are as chair of Sig testing?
00:46:29 [W] I feel like the project has a lot of challenges in its test code base.
00:46:38 [W] It is extremely painful to contribute to kubernative at times because tests you didn't write our are failing and I think that's sort of a tragedy of the commons problem that we definitely need help
00:46:47 [W] I think that it aligns with the steering committees challenge of how do we encourage people to do the right thing as opposed to trying to force people to do something.
00:47:03 [W] So anyway, so sometimes when you look at it from sorry somebody else keep it keep it. Keep it quick damned.
00:47:08 [W] when you when you look at it from outside.
00:47:13 [W] seems like there's a lot of people working on a lot of things within kubernative, but we still really need you what you bring to the table is really important.
00:47:18 [W] Oughtn't and we could use your help.
00:47:22 [W] Even if it is a simple taking notes doing writing some documentation writing some tests.
00:47:28 [W] Whatever you can do.
00:47:30 [W] We will take it with you know with you know with great humility.
00:47:37 [W] So, please please do try from your side whatever you can be doing.
00:47:40 [W] Excellent.
00:47:43 [W] Thank you so much that concludes this session.
00:47:54 [W] I want to thank everybody for showing up and asking these wonderful questions and I want to thank steering for actually taking the time to meet with the community and answer their questions. The conversation doesn't have to stop here.
00:47:55 [W] I know we'll all be in this lack of the cube Connie you slack channel. So feel free to join us in ask any questions there, but we thank you for joining have a wonderful Cube con Cloud native Connie you enjoy the virtual experience as I know I am and we'll see you all in the community.
00:48:09 [W] Thank you very much. Bye.
