Transcription for wordly [W]

00:07:57 [W] Good morning and afternoon everybody.
00:13:16 [W] My name is j our store meant and I am the executive director of the finops foundation and the finops foundation is a part of the Linux Foundation, which is a sister organization to cncf which sure you're
00:13:26 [W] S were sister organization to cncf which sure you're all familiar with today.
00:13:30 [W] We're going to be talking about finops and finops is the practice of cloud financial management.
00:13:38 [W] We've got a great lineup of speakers who are both experts and practitioners and vendors in this space.
00:13:44 [W] who are going to share their knowledge and expertise with you and specifically in this we are going to be focused around the aspect of how to do Cloud financial management.
00:13:52 [W] It for kubernative use in a container environment.
00:14:00 [W] So I'm going to start my screen share here, and we will kick off.
00:14:01 [W] Excellent. So what before we get started I wanted to talk a little bit about the challenge of confidential management for kubernative.
00:14:19 [W] But why does this space exists?
00:14:21 [W] Why do we find that managing finances in clout is a challenge and I think where we had need to start with that conversation is really going back to the world of data centers. And what happened?
00:14:30 [W] When an organization needed to get access to Hardware in that case, they would think of you know, what requirements they needed what harder they needed and they would then go and build a business case and go to their procurement teams, right and those
00:14:46 [W] Would essentially evaluate that business case and they would come back with the money for the hardware that was needed. Now in this model there were pros and cons right? So you had essentially Engineers working as requesters
00:15:01 [W] Finance people or procurement people acting as approvers as part of this and the good news was spend was really predictable.
00:15:13 [W] You know, you knew what you were going to spend. You know, how it was going to work.
00:15:15 [W] But the bad news was you had really long procurement cycles and really there was a high cost of failure for projects, right if you spent the money and then went to change it it was already out the door.
00:15:27 [W] So this problem gets even more intense in a world where you switch from small groups of platform teams on the cloud to lots and lots of service teams, right service teams who are running lots of microservices.
00:15:43 [W] We're probably working across lots of different clouds lots of different environments and development areas and introduce another aspect of their which is software being written with infrastructure as a code.
00:15:55 [W] So suddenly these Engineers can spin up resources over they need whenever
00:15:58 [W] Wants and the entire Dynamic shifts to this world where they can go straight to the money now the engineering teams and the Ops teams essentially have the credit card that can buy whatever resources they need.
00:16:13 [W] So this makes the procurement people and finance people unhappy and not only unhappy it also puts them in a spot where they really can't do their fiduciary job to the company.
00:16:22 [W] So this is where finops comes in finops is a way to essentially help solve this problem. It's a
00:16:28 [W] Best practices of culture which essentially enable these teams to come together to work in ways. They haven't before engineering teams business teams Finance procurement given them this common lexicon and a set of processes for chargeback
00:16:47 [W] Work in ways. They haven't before engineering teams business teams Finance procurement giving them this common lexicon and a set of processes for chargeback optimization decisions so that to that last line on the screen there those teams can
00:16:54 [W] decisions so that to that last line on the screen there those teams can essentially figure out how to get the best value out of every dollar that they spend in Cloud that last line is really important because confidential management finops are
00:17:04 [W] Spending less money in Cloud.
00:17:12 [W] It's about making choices that give you the best outputs for that because in a lot of cases, we find that spending more in Cloud actually may be successful, right you're migrating more resources out or over to cloud or potentially your business is growing
00:17:22 [W] Finops has implemented and we're going to talk a bit about what that looks like today specifically in a kubernative world some good things happen.
00:17:37 [W] So the first of those is these teams now start to get act together as one instead of engineering operations team during a loan doing their thing and finance procurement teams, trying to pour out a later they're coming together to make decisions.
00:17:45 [W] So you get that instant procurement you get agility, but with predictable budgets and cost and really lowering the cost of failure.
00:17:53 [W] So there's lots of names for this practice.
00:18:01 [W] Don't get stuck on it. If you don't call it finops, you might call it Cloud financial management or cost optimization Mark Schwartz at AWS.
00:18:05 [W] Did a Blog about finding Dev.
00:18:08 [W] I think Corey Quinn calls a cloud economics.
00:18:08 [W] There's Cloud cost management.
00:18:15 [W] There's all types of name. So these are all different words for ways to get that most value out of cloud.
00:18:18 [W] I'm going to refer to it here as finops because it's fast and short and easy but in your practice and the people that we work with and have met over the years.
00:18:23 [W] Doing this have literally hundreds of different titles and names or what they call this but they all center around a core set of practical principles and a consistent set of stakeholders. So I'm not going to read each of these on here, but the
00:18:37 [W] Balls, and these were developed with the practitioners within the finops foundation. And then in collaboration with AWS last year are really focused on how do we bring those teams together to collaborate? Well, so they can start to make those decisions and the key thing the
00:18:53 [W] About here and we talked a lot about in the open source Summit in June is that you really want everyone to take ownership for their Cloud usage, right?
00:19:03 [W] This is about driving accountability out to the edge so that those individual teams and sometimes there's hundreds of them in an organization can get access to accessible timely up-to-date accurate and granular reporting about what's happening
00:19:17 [W] Emily is or reporting or anything else or dashboarding so that they can start to take actions.
00:19:27 [W] Now the fifth Point sometimes confuses people is centralized team.
00:19:30 [W] Will you just said we need to decentralize accountability?
00:19:35 [W] We still typically see a centralized team in organizations who are focused on driving those best practices driving out the recommendations driving out the reporting that team is typically responsible for things like rate optimizations, and you know reserved instances in savings plans and committed
00:19:45 [W] And the idea here to the sixth is really to move everybody to a world where we're taking advantage of the variable model of cloud right to often migrations, whether they be newer sort of cloud native companies or those aspiring to be Cloud native or older
00:20:01 [W] Running Cloud really like a data center, right?
00:20:06 [W] They leave everything all the time on all the time.
00:20:13 [W] So as part of this as we see on the right the lots of different people involved all coming together across the organization in order to really do this specific thing, which is to bring that visibility to drive better decision making within the
00:20:22 [W] This specific thing which is to bring that visibility to drive better decision making within the organization's.
00:20:27 [W] So what does that look like engineering metrics, you know, there's a lot of things that's engineering teams have particular track and are used to tracking and thinking about engineers don't like in efficiency. Typically they're
00:20:38 [W] Like in efficiency, typically, they're thinking about latency and memory and CPU and requests all these different areas for engineering teams. And we're focusing a lot of our efforts in conversations today around this group because of the audience of this Summit we need to start
00:20:51 [W] If you can't reduce cost as a first class citizen for engineering operations teams architecture teams to consider as they are thinking about what they're deploying because now these engineering teams have the ability to make changes that actually can affect the
00:21:06 [W] Teams have the ability to make changes that actually can affect the bottom line of the company.
00:21:08 [W] So that brings us to what we're covering today, which is sorry my screen share just dropped off there, which is a finops for kubernative A's and I wanted to give you a little introduction to the finops foundation and what we're going to be
00:21:24 [W] And from here because all the speakers that you're going to be hearing from today are part of the finops foundation and all the best practices that we talked about are drawn from this group.
00:21:38 [W] So the mission of the foundation which is now officially a program of the Linux Foundation is to be a Central Community for cloud financial management. And this is regardless of what cloud you're using or what vendor or what management tool
00:21:48 [W] Else so we host a lot of virtual events.
00:21:55 [W] We've got another one this afternoon happening that will tell you about later on.
00:21:56 [W] I need to be a savings plans.
00:21:58 [W] We've got an active Meetup Community around the world.
00:22:00 [W] We've got a slap that's got a lot of folks having conversations and these people come together to the second Point help Advance, not only the discipline but also their careers this is a nascent and evolving space and we find that it's really hard to go say.
00:22:13 [W] Hey, I need to hire a clown Financial Manager a Club business office person or a cost optimization person. There's not a college program for that.
00:22:19 [W] That there's not typically a dedicated jobs board. Although if you go to our website, we have a jobs board.
00:22:25 [W] So we do a lot of work around education training and development of these people and the third area where we are very excited to be partnering with the Linux foundation in this new chapter is building out open source standards around this nascent space.
00:22:38 [W] Although if you go to our website, we do have a jobs board.
00:22:39 [W] So we do a lot of work around education training and development of these people.
00:22:40 [W] And the third area where we are very excited to be partnering with the Linux foundation in this new chapter is building out open source standards around this nascent space.
00:22:42 [W] So this is looking like, you know, what are the capabilities of a finops team?
00:22:47 [W] You know, what sort of kpi should they be looking at? What is it proper charge back or allocation or tagging model look like these are all now being built out in our GitHub repository and invite you to be a part of this process.
00:22:58 [W] So finops Foundation has been really exciting to see with very little promotion or sort of, you know, marketing behind it.
00:23:10 [W] It's had some pretty exciting growth in the last year. We started this with just 26 practitioners.
00:23:18 [W] This came out of I used to be a co-founder of cloudevents D and working in the cab there.
00:23:22 [W] We kept hearing people say hey, we don't just want to talk about technology.
00:23:24 [W] We want to hear about the best practices. We want to talk to each other. We want to understand the discipline. So as
00:23:28 [W] Starting to scale this out when you realize we needed to really make it clearly open source, vendor-neutral best practices organization, and we just joined the Linux Foundation to do that and we're seeing some really exciting participation. The Beating Heart of the organization are practitioner
00:23:43 [W] I used to be a co-founder of cloudevents D and working in the cab there.
00:23:44 [W] We kept hearing people say hey, we don't just want to talk about technology.
00:23:44 [W] We want to hear about the best practices.
00:23:45 [W] We want to talk to each other. We want to understand the discipline.
00:23:46 [W] So as we started to scale this out when you realize we needed to really make it clearly open source, vendor-neutral best practices organization, and we just joined the Linux Foundation to do that and we're seeing some really exciting participation the Beating Heart of the organization are
00:23:48 [W] The people in end-user companies who are actually doing finops.
00:23:49 [W] we've got about as of yesterday. We broke two thousand of those individuals and their in their really defining and talking best practices in our slack in the various areas and take advantage of things like the certifications that we offer in contributing to the
00:24:02 [W] Book last year with O'Reilly called Cloud fin Ops, which is really a collection of the stories and best practices from these individuals.
00:24:15 [W] So one of the things that we are announcing today, and that we hinted at of the open source Summit is the addition of new vendor member programs.
00:24:25 [W] We've been completely focused on practitioners to date bringing in that sort of best practice and we heard from the practitioners to consistent themes over the last year one was that there's a lot of expertise in the clouds the club management vendors
00:24:39 [W] Is were out there doing this work and the practitioners one ensure that expertise was brought into the fold of what we're doing.
00:24:54 [W] But also they want to make sure that when they went to work with a vendor whether it be a get a cloud of consultant or a metonym management vendor that we were all speaking the same language that the foundation and the practitioners hadn't thought of one set of best practices
00:25:02 [W] It was using another so as part of this we launched three programs that we announced at the open source Summit in June.
00:25:12 [W] The first is a finops training partner program.
00:25:14 [W] The second is the finops certified platform program and the third is the finops certified service provider program. And each of these programs following the cloud native Computing foundation and Linux Foundation models are based
00:25:27 [W] Knob certified platform program and the third is the finops certified service provider program. And each of these programs following the cloud native Computing foundation and Linux Foundation models are based on companies
00:25:29 [W] Is joining our foundation and hitting a certain set of criteria to be a part of these so very excited to announce today the initial 11 vendor member companies who have joined the finops foundation big
00:25:43 [W] You are leading Premier member, which is cloud Health by VMware. Very excited to share what these individuals are going to be doing just got a note that some questions are rolling in. Also, we will answer those a little bit later also
00:25:58 [W] Cloudbees literally which was the original founding partner and really helped launched this back in 2009 with both funding and in-kind help along the way and very excited to bring in the additional nine Partners listed here on the screen Cloud easier Cloud soft
00:26:14 [W] Bring in the additional nine Partners listed here on the screen Cloud easier Cloud soft Cloud wise lots of clouds Contino Cube cost NEOS mlops Ani Prosper Ops and Tim Spirits.
00:26:24 [W] So you're going to learn more about all these on our website as I talk about these programs and we'll hear from a few of these companies today as part of the content that we are covering.
00:26:33 [W] So let's look at each of the individual programs.
00:26:40 [W] I think this is the program that we've heard the most from practitioners that they wanted which was a program that map's capabilities of finops against individual service providers.
00:26:52 [W] We built a very nascent set of these capabilities that were beginning to map providers against the initial program partners for this are the ones listed here on the screen will be doing a lot of work in the coming months to really grow that list of capabilities along with the members
00:27:02 [W] Themselves to further Define these but if you look at our website, you can find out in our GitHub more about the capabilities that these companies offer.
00:27:18 [W] I am moving faster if you have a lot of content so apologies if I don't cover anything that you want to hear you can drop that in the Q&A.
00:27:20 [W] The next one is the finops training partner program.
00:27:25 [W] We have offered a number of certifications and trainings through the finops foundation.
00:27:32 [W] We've heard from practitioners that they want to both be able to get these in their Regional areas and get it specialized and
00:27:33 [W] focus and customized into services that both platforms and consultancies offer.
00:27:43 [W] So this program is very much based around the model of offering training.
00:27:45 [W] We offer instructor-led courses that we've been doing now for I think we've done 15 or 20 of them now in the last few quarters virtually. These are now also going to be offered by the private and custom Training partners that finops trading partners as well as the free interred at finops course.
00:27:58 [W] X and then these certifications the first one on the right is available. Now it's now through the Linux Foundation the finops certified practitioner with additionals coming down the road.
00:28:14 [W] So big shout out to the for finops trading partners cloudevents a cloud Health Cloud easier and Contino. All of these are now certified to offer these trainings and then in are essentially going to be resellers of the
00:28:24 [W] If I'd practitioner certification which will for consistency steak still go through the Linux Foundation to ensure that everyone meets the same standards.
00:28:34 [W] And the last program is the finops certified service provider program.
00:28:41 [W] This one is really geared and focused on companies who provide services around finops whether that be consultancy or advisory services in this area really great group of companies here on the screen few more so I won't read them all out.
00:28:54 [W] We're excited to see a lot more coming down the road again.
00:29:00 [W] check out our website and our slack. For more information on these most exciting to me I think is probably the formation of this new technical advisory Council, which is going to be basically working in the open on GitHub to find the capabilities and the curriculums and the open source needs.
00:29:14 [W] basically working in the open on GitHub to find the capabilities and the curriculums and the open source needs for all these areas as part of this excited to announce today that we have added a number of new individuals to this mic Fuller who is the co-author
00:29:23 [W] Mike Fuller who is the co-author of the book is going to be the text chair from atlassian excited. Also add Eugene.
00:29:29 [W] Kostov who is from a PCO Cloud ability.
00:29:33 [W] He was formerly on the AWS insights team and building out their products. John McLaughlin who is from cloud Health VMware.
00:29:39 [W] We're going to hear from one of his colleagues later today that Leonard who is billing product lead for Google Cloud.
00:29:49 [W] He formerly did this for ews and for Microsoft so great expertise there and Debo from his team is going to be talking today Ashley remote Co who shared a
00:29:55 [W] Best practices over the last year in the foundation from Pearson and Jody Lee from Nationwide who's also been one of the core contributing members.
00:30:00 [W] We will be adding additional folks in the coming months that will be by the charter which is on GitHub. If you want to read it is structured really to be a combination of practitioners General Premier members and Industry appointed people
00:30:14 [W] build the Lexicon of s practices over time
00:30:18 [W] so jumping back after all those announcements and of course, I'm already on overtime, which I told us because I wouldn't let them do to this world where you've got all these Services teams looking for money and bypassing procurement.
00:30:34 [W] We now going to introduce for the topic today what happens in the world of kubernative.
00:30:47 [W] He's with this happening. And what I wanted to highlight is an intro is that the world of communities adds layers and layers of virtualization on top of this challenge we had before in Cloud, which is
00:30:49 [W] Figure out what Seidel what resources to remove trying to figure out what to write size whether it be used to be instances and now you need to do clusters and namespaces and figure out resource utilization for those it adds complication to this challenge
00:31:04 [W] Virtualization on top of this challenge we had before in Cloud. Just trying to figure out what Seidel what resources to remove trying to figure out what to write size whether it be used to be instances. And now you need to do clusters and namespaces and figure out
00:31:07 [W] Recommend two teams.
00:31:08 [W] What do they spin up spin down? How do they size their resources?
00:31:09 [W] It and it makes it much more difficult to start to report out wastage to these teams, right the areas of you've said you're going to use this thing.
00:31:18 [W] Now, what are you really using the real challenge here?
00:31:27 [W] I think and as a number of our speakers are going to get to is around the world of how do we start to take? All these differently sized, you know buckets of spinned not buckets in the AWS sense, but buckets in the sense of clusters labels namespaces to figure out how to then allocate those
00:31:36 [W] James this is one of the biggest challenges of finops confidential management is getting charged back accurate so that we can get to that world. We talked about the Nirvana of helping teams make better decisions.
00:31:51 [W] So with all of that very excited to introduce our lightning talks today.
00:31:59 [W] All these speakers are going to be contributing contents to is going to be a white an open-source white paper.
00:32:06 [W] That is launching in November at Cloud native Con on this topic.
00:32:06 [W] This is our lineup today.
00:32:10 [W] I'll let each of them introduce ourselves in the integers themselves rather in the interest of time for this but a great mix of practitioners clouds and Cloud management vendors.
00:32:19 [W] We're going to help us unpack this problem at the end of this we are going to do a QA we've had some questions coming in will speak to as many of those as possible and we have just launched the finops swag store.
00:32:32 [W] I'm wearing one of the shirts today the finops on the back here for everybody who asks a
00:32:37 [W] That we take that we think is a good question.
00:32:46 [W] We'll be giving you a $25 gift card to go buy an awesome finops t-shirt or sticker or something like that.
00:32:49 [W] So, please get your questions ready and excited to hear from each of our speakers with that.
00:32:55 [W] I am going to stop my screen share and pass to Sasha from Life ramp.
00:32:59 [W] Great.
00:33:04 [W] That we take that we think is a good question.
00:33:07 [W] We'll be giving you a $25 gift card to go buy an awesome finops t-shirt or sticker or something like that.
00:33:08 [W] So, please get your questions ready and excited to hear from each of our speakers with that.
00:33:09 [W] am going to stop my screen share and pass to Sasha from Life ramp.
00:33:10 [W] Great.
00:33:10 [W] Thanks very much.
00:33:10 [W] Jay are and hello to all the conference participants when I was trying to think of what I wanted to talk about.
00:33:14 [W] I tried to put myself in your shoes. And we were there about two years ago when we were pursuing a migration from our on-premise data center to TCP and we decided to containerize at the same
00:33:28 [W] Self in your shoes, and we were there about two years ago when we were pursuing a migration from our on-premise data center to TCP and we decided to containerize at the same time.
00:33:32 [W] And so I tried to think back to the kind of challenges that we had and where I Look to for help and resources at that time and you're going to hear me repeat myself a bit during the conversation. That's only because
00:33:44 [W] cuz I want to reinforce.
00:33:47 [W] All the things we did that you can do to avoid the pain of managing your kubernative clusters in the cloud as it relates to the cost of it and perhaps like some of the ancillary
00:34:04 [W] Things you'd have to think about so bit of context on live ramp.
00:34:14 [W] I'm the head of global Cloud operations for life around.
00:34:16 [W] We are headquartered in San Francisco and have about 1300 employees. We have over 200 developers and we transform data for marketing
00:34:29 [W] Over 200 developers and we transform data for marketing companies for the most part.
00:34:32 [W] We help them connect to their customers and in support of that.
00:34:39 [W] We had an on-premise data center in San Francisco.
00:34:47 [W] Now before I get into the details of our environment to set the context so you all understand how we approached our kubernative problems iot.
00:34:50 [W] I wanted to take a quick moment to number one.
00:34:55 [W] thank gr. For organizing this and for the rest of the speakers on the panel.
00:35:00 [W] There are representatives from the CMP space here.
00:35:07 [W] I it's quite a bit of an art to develop software for developers and we certainly appreciate all the software that was available to us when we were trying to solve this problem. And then the other thing I would note is that if you are
00:35:18 [W] On the call who's new to finops and you're trying to understand how we can help you solve your your problems related to Cloud spend in Coop.
00:35:29 [W] I would definitely join the finops foundation.
00:35:34 [W] It was something that we discovered about six months into our migration and we discovered that someone else had perfectly synthesized and articulated all the points that we were beginning to explore and
00:35:45 [W] We're already brewing in our minds based on the pain that we are experiencing ourselves. And when we join the foundation and the stock Channel thus, excuse me, the Splat group that it has we discovered conversations that were like incredibly relevant.
00:36:00 [W] Problems that we are trying to solve and we spent literally months going through the conversations and figuring out what we should do as a company ourselves. So if you are in this space and
00:36:16 [W] Finops show Nation yet, and you haven't joined the slack group. I would definitely do that immediately.
00:36:26 [W] Thank you so much for making it available.
00:36:36 [W] So in terms of live ramp and our background, I wanted to set the context and help you understand how we arrived at the problems. We arrived at we are migrating from an on-premise data center with about
00:36:42 [W] Notes about a hundred petabyte-scale data.
00:36:46 [W] We had not yet containerize.
00:36:47 [W] We were running in VMS and we were using the VMware vcenter apis to automate most of our traffic was.
00:37:00 [W] probably about
00:37:03 [W] they're petabyte-scale data going back and forth every day on behalf of our customers and we were migrating because we were in a data center in San Francisco.
00:37:18 [W] And for those of you don't know San Francisco is active earthquake country.
00:37:31 [W] We were in a data center that we had joined when we were a fledgling startup and we didn't have 3,000 Hadoop nodes. We just had
00:37:33 [W] And then 50 then a hundred and then 400 and we began to outstrip their capacity as well.
00:37:44 [W] We couldn't do Dr. Effectively as well.
00:37:47 [W] And so for all those different reasons, we wanted to migrate to the cloud.
00:37:54 [W] We also wanted to give our developers the opportunity to deploy infrastructure by API, and we could do that with gcp in AWS and those vendors and so we embarked on this
00:38:02 [W] Massive migration we did planning for about six months. And then the execution took about a year. We ran our on-premise data center at the same time that we were migrating to the cloud now
00:38:19 [W] Year, we ran our on-premise data center at the same time that we were migrating to the cloud. Now when we first deployed kubernative, we we were using car Wes on physical Hardware
00:38:26 [W] First deployed kubernative zwi. We were using Cora Wes on physical Hardware in our on-premise data set and that gave us some tools. There was very little cost visibility that
00:38:34 [W] knative Lee from doing that and so we started to think about gke and we knew that it would give us an API that would work very consistently we felt that
00:38:51 [W] The Best in Class to land so we decided it in the cloud. We were just going to use gke rather than deploying car Wes into the cloud as well.
00:39:07 [W] One of the things that happen in the background that we began to understand is a point that Jr.
00:39:13 [W] Mentioned earlier, which is that yes, we were giving the developers in API and the controller to spin up resources anytime. But really that was also an API to spend money at will
00:39:24 [W] And we kind of understood that but it really didn't.
00:39:28 [W] hammering home until the finance folks arrived at our door and asked us what this new spend that they were seeing was and so I think it's at that point that we began to actually can
00:39:43 [W] Finops a bit. So the perceived value that we thought we were getting in the cloud.
00:39:54 [W] We certainly got we had a successful migration a six it's exit a successful technical migration and you know, we sort of declared Victory and about a month after we had completed the migration all of
00:40:07 [W] are the finance folks began to notice that our budget was something like 50 percent over what it should have been and that was primarily because we had migrated
00:40:23 [W] Yet had the cultural shift in our company and helped our developers understand what their Newfound responsibilities work now when we were
00:40:38 [W] Ke and we are trying to figure out how it should operate within the cloud.
00:40:46 [W] Should we have one large cluster?
00:40:50 [W] Should we have a bunch of small clusters?
00:40:54 [W] We were rationalizing our decision in different ways.
00:41:00 [W] We were thinking about Security First we were thinking about cost boundaries as well.
00:41:08 [W] And with the, you know, the Specter of devops in the background, you know, we had given our developers full.
00:41:09 [W] Troll over their environments our Central devops team built tooling for other devs to manage their own environments. And so at the time it made a lot of sense to us that we should have.
00:41:24 [W] A cluster per team give them full control to deploy into that to stand up the cluster themselves to give them tools to support that and sort of let them run on their own because the perception was they wanted to
00:41:41 [W] Option was having that control would allow them to go faster and we would simply provide tooling and they'd be sort of happy with that. And each cluster was its own cost and security boundaries.
00:41:57 [W] This is another interesting point the kind of tools that existed two years ago or two and a half years ago when we first started using gke and the tools that exist today both from from Google.
00:42:12 [W] and from cmps are radically different and I think they would definitely influence our decision and how we would choose to do things today if we were to do them and so at the time two years ago
00:42:27 [W] Make sense this model of a cluster per team.
00:42:35 [W] And so we ended up with something like a hundred different clusters and it worked.
00:42:38 [W] Okay for us. What we discovered was number one.
00:42:46 [W] There was some developers like let's say we have a front end development team that really didn't want to know how to stand up their own cluster.
00:42:56 [W] They just wanted a Target to just drop a
00:42:58 [W] Boehner using a pipeline and then it's off and running they weren't excited about managing their own environments and that was a surprise to us, but it seemed to make sense because
00:43:12 [W] If if they can spend their time doing some other work that's related to production that delivers more value for the company.
00:43:27 [W] There isn't a great reason for them to run and manage their own cluster.
00:43:35 [W] So that is one of the things that we likely change today, which is I think we'd have a default policy of having a one one or two large common clusters and
00:43:42 [W] In for a team that wants it to have their own cluster as well.
00:43:49 [W] Now as it relates to cost attribution, there is a challenge there and I think the challenge can be addressed today with things like namespacing if you're going to have a large cluster.
00:44:02 [W] figure out which containers are associated with which team and then to find a way to attribute the cost of the of their resources running directly to that team into that product as well, but I think
00:44:18 [W] name spacing within UK does that I think that we would probably try to use cloud run where possible and it eliminates, you know the the
00:44:35 [W] And it makes it easier to attribute cost as well.
00:44:46 [W] I think the vendors have come in and provided very interesting tooling that allows you to attribute costs within kubernative.
00:44:51 [W] I know that caught ability has something in the space.
00:44:53 [W] We have not used Cloud run, but I'd be curious to know if they've got that going as well.
00:45:00 [W] I think using a CMP is probably a good thing now, I don't want to
00:45:05 [W] I advertised on their behalf, but I think it would be very difficult for us to properly attribute cost for gke specifically if we were only using the knative tooling provided by
00:45:20 [W] Now they do a great job of releasing new apis of recorder and the abilities and the central console improve consistently, but there's a super set of features that we find with this emps. That made it very compelling
00:45:35 [W] Ticular so I think I'd like to hand it off to Debo but just to summarize some of the recommendations that I would have for those of you in the audience pursuing
00:45:51 [W] Recommendations that I would have for those of you in the audience pursuing cost management for your Coop clusters. Number one use the finops foundation slack group as a means to discover.
00:46:02 [W] A means to discover other people's pain that looks a lot similar to the pain that you're about to go through and learn from it and incorporate that information into your design.
00:46:15 [W] I would say read the finops book if you can get it.
00:46:21 [W] It's a great synthesis of all the information that's been in the groups and conversations apparently for the last, you know, five six seven years.
00:46:36 [W] I would definitely consider using the knative tooling for you know, if you're a startup, but once you get Beyond, you know, let's say, you know fifty to a hundred thousand dollars or spend I would begin to
00:46:46 [W] to look at some of the tools in this space in the CMP space. So with that said, I'm going to hand it off to Depot from gcp to continue the talk.
00:47:00 [W] All right.
00:47:08 [W] Well what all the attendees and thanks for joining us in these very unusual but still leading in information times. She wanted to go ahead and make sure that I take the chance to thank Sasha for all the
00:47:18 [W] Is a great tip for me because as a customer and someone who's really looking at this very carefully, I think that there's nothing that can replace experience to go alongside advice. So let me go ahead and share my screen here
00:47:34 [W] You got started myself.
00:47:40 [W] if you can give me just a second.
00:47:41 [W] Right if you're ready to go. So just by way of introduction.
00:47:51 [W] My name is Devo as I mentioned earlier and I've been a product manager at Google for the last couple of years my career in terms of the cloud space started at AWS where I was working at the market place and I really focus there on really helping
00:48:03 [W] Way of introduction.
00:48:04 [W] My name is Devo as I mentioned earlier and I've been a product manager at Google for the last couple of years my career in terms of the cloud space started at AWS where I was working at the market place and I really focus there on really helping
00:48:06 [W] To software that allowed them to utilize Cloud infrastructure and the best ways to do other functions like manage fire firewalls deal with Cloud application development controllers and other things like that, and I kind of transitioned into Google
00:48:19 [W] Look at the scope of how people are dealing with cost management and all the ads I want is that go along with it?
00:48:27 [W] So that includes metering and Telemetry and includes looking at their data as it flows through not just Building Systems for Commerce systems usage systems that we control here at Google and then of course where I am now and cost management, so I work with Matt
00:48:41 [W] Member of the finops foundation corporate of members to help here as a team lead and I really focus on making sure that customers can understand their costs as a as respective containers of value for their workloads.
00:48:56 [W] So we think about gcp as a vendor in the space really think about gke and Google Cloud platform.
00:49:12 [W] So as you can see here, we've done a lot of work to make sure that we really have a dashboard that allows people to really control things but not necessarily have to die super deep into the world of compute in order to manage things.
00:49:19 [W] That's really the flexibly Define resources that are scalable with your application.
00:49:24 [W] Right? So we've heard a lot of reasons that folks love to roll with
00:49:30 [W] Uke the idea that it's knative that you've got crew Nettie's and gku really working together so that upgrading your nodes and by that we mean your clusters and all the things that come with them is easy.
00:49:42 [W] We get those releases. Well, we have GK and Doc are working well together.
00:49:50 [W] So GK is can schedule those containers based on the requirements and configurations that you manage which is a nice way to be able to do it.
00:49:52 [W] Especially if you're familiar with Docker and containerization networking is a lot easier because you're managing your network scaling and
00:49:57 [W] Ian's a various granularities whether it's the podcast stir the node and it's all managed in a single place.
00:50:10 [W] So you're dealing with auto scaling an automatic node creation and deletion based on whether or not the master sees that the policy is going to be correct, right and all that drives towards price as long as you are flexibly able to define the your pay as you go structure
00:50:18 [W] Well with your application, right?
00:50:19 [W] So we've heard a lot of reasons that folks love to roll with gke the idea that it's knative that you've got crew Nettie's and gku really working together so that upgrading your nodes and by that we mean your clusters and all the things that come with them is easy.
00:50:20 [W] We get those releases. Well, we have G ke and Doc are working well together.
00:50:22 [W] So GK is can schedule those containers based on the requirements and configurations that you manage which is a nice way to be able to do it. Especially if you're familiar with Docker container is a
00:50:23 [W] ation networking is a lot easier because you're managing your network scaling and connections a various granularities, whether it's the podcast stir the node and it's all managed in a single place. So you're dealing with auto scaling an automatic node
00:50:28 [W] Really?
00:50:28 [W] It's managed commute compute.
00:50:29 [W] Sorry and you're dealing with committed use discounts.
00:50:29 [W] There's a lot of different ways for you to get when you know, you're stable usage discounts on what you're actually trying to deal with in terms of your compute storage and other needs so we've heard that a lot of folks are very happy and and are continuing to dive deep and
00:50:39 [W] To using gke because of all these reasons but you know, you're not just here to learn about GK Ian and what people use a year you're learning about. Okay, so I'm using GK your I'm using an any Cloud really the
00:50:54 [W] Compute such that I can spend a little bit more time focusing on my containers ation and applications unless time focusing on the nuts and bolts of exactly what VM I need to schedule which workloads.
00:51:25 [W] It and avoid surprises because even though we may have different types of hierarchies.
00:51:34 [W] They'll be organized our workloads in we want to monitor them all to make sure that they're getting enough enough feedback to make decisions.
00:51:39 [W] We want to think about scaling so that we can meet the demand of our customers in turn even as we serve as a customer for Google and we want to make sure that we scale in ways that make sense, right?
00:51:51 [W] depending on how we set up our infrastructure and how we set up our flexible organizations within our organization. So whatever.
00:51:56 [W] Teams might be using kubenetes.
00:52:03 [W] We want to make sure that they have the ability to make scaling decisions at their levels as well as the larger level for the whole group and then restricting usage and costs where it does not generate value or just learning that I can shut things down and not have to really think about it
00:52:12 [W] Our customers in turn even as we serve as a customer for Google and we want to make sure that we scale in ways that make sense, right?
00:52:14 [W] So depending on how we set up our infrastructure and how we set up our flexible organizations within our organization. So whatever teams might be using kubermatic we want to make sure that they have the ability to make scaling decisions at their levels as well as the larger level for the
00:52:15 [W] You know the micromanagement of your compute storage and other resources.
00:52:17 [W] so it's pretty interesting when we talk to many of our customers in terms of what is most important to them when it comes to dealing with the resources and infrastructure the using us as you can see here folks really are very
00:52:33 [W] Conscious and they understand that they get a lot of flexibility in the abstract things one layer away, but they still care about how we're managing their cost for infrastructure, especially when you're coming from a data center where costs were more fixed on a little bit more predictable
00:52:48 [W] In terms of moving into the cloud and continuing going forward and then beyond that it's ideas for cost savings continually as you get better and more mature at managing your spend forecasting more spend and limiting
00:53:03 [W] surprises just as I mentioned before in the previous slide, you know beyond that trust between it and finance project level spend and even in containers other than just project but maybe the flexible ways
00:53:17 [W] And finance project level spend and even in containers other than just project but maybe the flexible ways that you wanted to find how your infrastructure looks you want to be able to make sure that you can communicate those costs the various stakeholder groups.
00:53:24 [W] Hi, your infrastructure looks you want to be able to make sure that you can communicate those costs of the various stakeholder groups, right?
00:53:27 [W] So all that scales into predictability.
00:53:29 [W] Everybody really wants to know how do I make my costs predictable?
00:53:42 [W] So when we look at it from a Google Cloud cost management perspective, we have four pillars that we really think about in terms of supporting Financial operations and making cost visible and accessible to the right people.
00:53:47 [W] So that's visibility the idea of built in
00:53:51 [W] Ports custom dashboards the bigquery building export that we have on our side that allows you to export all of your data streaming manner to make sure that your costs are available to you and you can do a lot of analysis whether it's custom orders
00:54:03 [W] And do a lot of analysis whether it's custom orders to simple analysis that we find very common for all of our customers.
00:54:07 [W] It's accountability.
00:54:09 [W] So that's thinking about the idea that you have flexible ways to organize your resources and allocate an attribute cost. So you can do chargeback which is the ability to say. Hey look devops.
00:54:22 [W] We want to make sure that you know, you've spent this much and this is what you're responsible for.
00:54:26 [W] maybe that is or is not over your budget and that might be true for several other groups within your organization.
00:54:33 [W] As well or just showing them, you know what they're spending and showing them the variance in the change in the spend.
00:54:37 [W] you've got control which is really just controlling for over spending reducing the predict reducing the The Runaway costs.
00:54:49 [W] that might come from maybe having a little bit of neglect from one part of your infrastructure versus being alerted being able to have programmatic controls. Once you realize there is some kind of aberration so that you can deal with that appropriately and finally in-toto.
00:55:00 [W] Legends the ability for Google Cloud specifically to be an advisor to you and say hey maybe you might want to do some right-sizing or Auto scaling or thinking about different kinds of costs optimizations that you can have so you can get a discount on your stable
00:55:15 [W] Lead to be an advisor to you and say hey, maybe you might want to do some right-sizing or Auto scaling or thinking about different kinds of costs optimizations that you can have so you can get a discount on your stable usage.
00:55:18 [W] We want to make sure that you are optimizing your Cloud Bill more often than not so, you know, it's helpful to think about this in terms of a few examples.
00:55:30 [W] And so I should just gave ones which is really helpful for us, but we've been hearing a lot of things as customers move because there's a lot of different
00:55:33 [W] areas of maturity that they have in terms of their Cloud Journey.
00:55:37 [W] So we've heard from customers who are saying hey, we're moving to from data centers directly into more of a kubernative type of scaling or a gke type of scaling so that we can focus on having an absent containerization Define our infrastructure usage.
00:55:51 [W] We have folks who are coming from compute engine we're saying hey manage my VMS I've now got thousands of them.
00:55:58 [W] That's kind of a pain.
00:55:59 [W] How can I cluster them? So they more better aligned to our applications that we need to Define.
00:56:03 [W] And so the first idea here that we talk about in terms of those customers that they may move from many projects or other definitions of their workloads to application defined workloads.
00:56:17 [W] So they want to say instead of having a thousand projects say hey many of these customers are contributing to a single application whether it's the front end or the back end of it and we wanted to find our infrastructure by that application instead and sort of moving to kubernative so we can actually use that
00:56:29 [W] So we can actually use that as a way of defining and pointing those workloads.
00:56:43 [W] Another example is, you know, dealing with the idea of having those clusters in those workloads defined but having name teams to namespaces so ability to flexibly define a name space that's going to be a cost container. You'll be charging
00:56:47 [W] and internally or keeping track and monitoring your costs according to that namespace and therefore those namespaces have different things to put in them for the dedicated functions that that part of a cluster or poddisruptionbudgets
00:57:02 [W] Lay, right we find that a lot of people are using kubernative labels to help Define.
00:57:08 [W] What a workloads may be used for and their hope is that by having those those kubernative labels available?
00:57:22 [W] They can again look at the costs across those labels so that if there's an application that's spanning across clusters in terms of utility or there's a team that spans across many clusters.
00:57:29 [W] They can use that kubernative label to organize them. Right but in all of these strategies they want to make sure they understand what their
00:57:33 [W] Drivers are you know because all the costs are divided the many ways across the workloads.
00:57:39 [W] So let's kind of take a look into that.
00:57:41 [W] Really when we think about workloads.
00:57:43 [W] It's kind of a matrix in terms of how the business and developers work together to see things.
00:57:53 [W] You've got the vertical structures of all the pieces of infrastructure that people are using like korres memory persistent disk Network egress, you know different ways to manage this workloads including Cloud run and those data products some of these other
00:58:02 [W] memory persistent disk Network egress, you know different ways to manage this workloads including Cloud run and those data products some of these other tools that are going to work alongside the infrastructure and applications that you're making and then you
00:58:07 [W] overlay the workloads F initials on top of those so that might be at the granularity of a pod of or a might be granularity of an application or project and the idea is that you don't want to have to think about the cost containers in terms of just one
00:58:22 [W] And the idea is that you don't want to have to think about the cost containers in terms of just one or the other because yes Google Cloud charges for the cores used the memory disks and all that. But if it's much more helpful for you to think about your costs in terms of your
00:58:32 [W] Helpful for you to think about your costs in terms of your application that you want to be able to include a little bit of each of those infrastructure departments in a total cost of ownership for your workload.
00:58:44 [W] So that's really what we're trying to drive to and help to make sure that you can understand and manage your costs the same way that you manage your workloads.
00:58:53 [W] So just driving in a little deeper.
00:58:54 [W] What does that mean?
00:58:59 [W] It means that we've got all these these different types of containers in the left, right? You see the building hi.
00:58:59 [W] Hierarchy or folder project you've got resources as I've mentioned just in the previous slide.
00:59:12 [W] You got your name spaces, which could be divulged to falter development or whatever and and space is appropriate for you and your labels right which could include everything from teman Department to version number subcomponents your sub customers customers who are who are working to you,
00:59:19 [W] These different types of containers in the left, right? You see the building hierarchy or folder project you've got resources as I've mentioned just in the previous slide.
00:59:24 [W] You got your name spaces, which could be divulged to Faults Are development or whatever and and space is appropriate for you and your labels, right which include everything from teman Department to version number subcomponents your sub customers customers, who are who are working to
00:59:26 [W] The things in the right everything from invoicing and dealing with audits to cost allocation answering questions and doing analysis forecasts budgets and variation optimization quotas and caps.
00:59:35 [W] No one to stop these things, right?
00:59:41 [W] So this is the general space that we're dealing with in terms of managing cost the same way you do your workloads in the kubernative world for us.
00:59:44 [W] So the kinds of questions that we tend to see tend to be more of how do I deal with costs versus utilization, right?
00:59:58 [W] So if you're actually spending based on the requests that kubernative making for your behalf, you know, how do you deal with the utilization their main kubernative? The GK team is really working to help deal with recommendations there.
01:00:07 [W] How can I focus on forecasts and budgets?
01:00:13 [W] How can I present these costs and do accountability for charge back and show back? You know, how can I manage kubernative?
01:00:15 [W] Is the platform across multiple clouds, you know and even Sachin talk a little bit about shared resources, right? One thing that we find particularly interesting is that folks are looking for ways to manage Network egress which may not necessarily be
01:00:29 [W] To allocate maybe you want to actually show the true direction of what areas of your clusters are using more Network address and others the same with storage right optimizing customer cluster management and going with lots of small clusters or
01:00:45 [W] Struzan, you know Tasha sample yet the few large clusters, but we also heard teams that say hey, we have really really experience with kubernetes.
01:00:55 [W] We want to do a lot of clusters as well.
01:01:00 [W] So I guess the big thing that I want to say here is there's a lot of questions that we see here.
01:01:01 [W] There's a lot of things that we want to answer but we're really driving towards a new experience and this is something that we're continually in iteratively working on to help you think about monetization flexibly moving across your workloads, right? So, you know, I don't
01:01:15 [W] Detailed to fish for the sake of time, but you can see on the right the user experiences of reporting by just an alerts billing exporter really going to help with that and you know, we're really driving to give people tools like GK usage metering which allows you to flexibly
01:01:30 [W] Some label and and those cost management Santos doing multi-cloud management and billing knative GK and anthos features.
01:01:42 [W] So that's just kind of the tip of the iceberg there.
01:01:45 [W] We understand a lot of the things that you want to do in this space and I want to make sure that Casey gets a chance, of course in the sprouting to you to talk a little bit about how they see it.
01:01:55 [W] But you know, I'm happy to answer any questions and give lots of materials in terms of dealing with Cloud management and cost management.
01:02:01 [W] Went from a gke and gcp perspective. So let me hand that over to Casey and thanks so much for listening.
01:02:09 [W] Great.
01:02:16 [W] Thanks Depot. Let me just click grab the screen here.
01:02:19 [W] Make sure that's all working.
01:02:22 [W] Okay, fantastic.
01:02:33 [W] So thanks to you both for that and it's actually great, you know to see some of the progress that you are making with usage metering love to see that so, you know first, you know before I dive in I really want to thank you know Jr.
01:02:43 [W] And the finops foundation, you know for invited us to be part of this and this amazing group as well as the cncf and everyone was kind of joining and listening in look forward to some of the Q&A afterwards for those of you that I have not met. My name's Casey Doran.
01:02:57 [W] Part of aptio for the last three years of can you not see my screen?
01:03:07 [W] I'm hearing that maybe you can't see my screen.
01:03:14 [W] Let me stop.
01:03:18 [W] And try it again.
01:03:21 [W] We seeing it now.
01:03:39 [W] Okay, great.
01:03:40 [W] Thanks for that.
01:03:43 [W] So, you know one thing that we've been working on quite a bit at cloudbees iot for the last few years is really digging into the challenges that everybody's been illustrating regarding cost allocation as well as optimization in a
01:03:56 [W] So I'm going to spend the next you know, seven or eight minutes, you know digging into some of those challenges some best practices around solving those challenges and how you can use some of those to overcome the same problem in your organization.
01:04:11 [W] Read into that and I want to start through a customer story. So, you know in kind of mid early to mid 2017.
01:04:22 [W] We had a lot of customers that start started to come to us with questions around this. So one in particular large, you know technology company utilizing multiple clouds through a variety of Acquisitions and they were working on transitioning to kubernative,
01:04:35 [W] LG company utilizing multiple clouds through a variety of Acquisitions and they were working on transitioning to kubernative.
01:04:37 [W] You know, a lot of great reasons to do that.
01:04:42 [W] But very quickly they encountered a cost allocation problem and this was critical to them and their organization to be able to Do complete charge back.
01:04:47 [W] So what are some of those challenges right?
01:04:51 [W] So immediately you start to lose visibility into consumption of these shared clusters that everybody's using the same cluster, you know, there's there's really a need to allocate that usage to
01:04:58 [W] The correct cost centers, you know, we're going to talk a little bit about some of the best ways to do that.
01:05:06 [W] And the reality here is it's not just one or the other right, you know, every team's you know, that using kubernative is likely going to have some kubenetes cost but some non kubernative costs and you really going to want to look at that all together.
01:05:17 [W] So what are some what are some best practices to help with these issues?
01:05:25 [W] first thing you're going to want to collect that utilization data, you know, so, you know Debo talked about namespaces that's going to be critical.
01:05:28 [W] To start pulling that data and associating with with the cloud billing data.
01:05:34 [W] You're also going to want to label your community's resources to line with those cost centers whether that's application team business unit Etc.
01:05:45 [W] And then you're going to want to unify that with the more traditional resource tag keys.
01:05:49 [W] So you're doing that in a unified way that's going to give you that ability to allocate holistically.
01:05:54 [W] You're Gonna Want to collect that utilization data, you know, so, you know Debo talked about namespaces that's going to be critical to start pulling that data and associating with with the cloud billing data.
01:06:06 [W] You're also going to want to label your committees resource.
01:06:07 [W] It's aligned with those cost centers whether that's application team business unit Etc.
01:06:08 [W] And then you're going to want to unify that with the more traditional resource tag keys.
01:06:08 [W] keys. So you're doing that in a unified way that's going to
01:06:11 [W] give you that ability to allocate holistically.
01:06:12 [W] So with that, you know, you're going to be able to allocate the costs, you know, based on those big kubernetes constructs.
01:06:16 [W] you're going to be able to analyze by those, you know in critical cost centers that you need to be charged do charge back for and then in the end you're going to be able to perform full allocation, you know across Kuma Daddy's and non kubernative workloads, you know and provide
01:06:17 [W] Do charge back for and then in the end you're going to be able to perform fall allocation, you know across Kuma Daddy's and non kubernative workloads, you know in provide those teams the insights, they need to perform better.
01:06:21 [W] So let's dig a little bit deeper into some of those challenges.
01:06:33 [W] So obviously, you know, somewhat oversimplified picture here, but here's kind of the traditional way that we used to do this and have done this for years, you know teams tended to have dedicated resources, you know, in this case we're looking at
01:06:35 [W] Different apps multiple Services across different Cloud providers but relatively straightforward in terms of allocation.
01:06:43 [W] You can use tags you tag key value pairs, you know, and then you look in the billing data analyze that go ahead and there's your allocation in the kubernative.
01:06:53 [W] The world is breaks down, right?
01:06:55 [W] So, you know, this vendor tags are not enough.
01:06:58 [W] enough. We're sharing clusters the same set of ends that we looked at in the previous screen.
01:07:02 [W] You know, but the you know their shared there's no way to just use the a specific tag, you know, and on top of that. There's going to be in Jr.
01:07:10 [W] Talked about this at the beginning.
01:07:12 [W] going to be some way some idle resources and are also going to want to understand how we can allocate that back to the right place.
01:07:19 [W] But it's actually more complex than that.
01:07:20 [W] Right?
01:07:23 [W] It's the reality is it's both right?
01:07:24 [W] we're going to have both situations, you know this Navy app, for example, they're running some things in kubernative, but they've also got some computer over on gcp and they're using some big query that's dedicated to them.
01:07:37 [W] So again the need to unify and do a single model for complete allocation.
01:07:40 [W] So let's talk about how we can help with this.
01:07:43 [W] Some oil resources and are also going to want to understand how we can allocate that back to the right place.
01:07:48 [W] But it's actually more complex than that.
01:07:48 [W] Right?
01:07:48 [W] It's the reality is it's both right?
01:07:48 [W] We're going to have both situations.
01:07:48 [W] you know this Navy app, for example, they're running some things in kubernative, but they've also got some computer over on gcp and they're using some big query that's dedicated to them.
01:07:51 [W] So again the need to unify and do a single model for complete allocation.
01:07:52 [W] So let's talk about how we can help with this.
01:07:52 [W] So the first thing is we talked about collecting utilization data, right? So pulling this utilization data from the underlying cluster resources. So memory CPU Network Etc by container object types, you know, namespace deployment
01:07:58 [W] Pulling this utilization data from the underlying cluster resources.
01:07:59 [W] So memory CPU Network Etc by container object types, you know, namespace deployment Damon set whatever is important for you, you know to allocate by as well as those label key value pairs, then you want to associate that utilization data with the underlying
01:08:07 [W] Whatever is important for you, you know to allocate by as well as those label key value pairs.
01:08:09 [W] Then you want to associate that utilization data with the underlying cluster cost for that allocation and one just Shameless plug, you know, we do have an open source metrics agent that helps with this collection.
01:08:18 [W] So this is something that you can you know, grab utilize yourself and then go ahead and pull this data.
01:08:21 [W] The next thing is that labeling strategy. So Debo got into this a little bit, you know, so think about what's important for you to perform allocation by is that app is a team. Is it Department?
01:08:38 [W] You want to live then align that across the different Cloud providers if you've got, you know, kubernative clusters in multiple clouds, make sure that you're doing that in the same way and if possible automate that so as your developers are rolling things out, you know,
01:08:48 [W] Is going out with that deployment and it's not happening after the fact.
01:08:53 [W] And then lastly and we talked about this a little bit that unified model for tags and labels. So you can see you know, the screenshot we're unifying the keys across team environment as well as application so we can look at
01:09:09 [W] other in a single model
01:09:12 [W] So now that we've done that.
01:09:16 [W] How does it come together right? So so the first thing, you know, you're able to visualize your kubenetes crop costs across cluster name space and the label, you know, and you can see in this case you're breaking down maybe what event originally was a
01:09:34 [W] 3C to buy the sub Civic specific usage of that by that specific name space and team
01:09:43 [W] You're also able to visualize your kubenetes and non communities costs together, right?
01:09:50 [W] So in this case, we're looking at a squad, you know, this squad has some kubenetes and entrepreneurs are using some, you know, some easy to Some Cloud watch but also have some things running a kubernative clusters.
01:10:00 [W] We're looking at this all in a single dashboard, you know and giving the ability to do that in one location based on having pulled this data.
01:10:09 [W] And then lastly, you know, this customer was able to pull all this data together, you know and create single dashboard.
01:10:19 [W] So then they you know across all these different constructs.
01:10:24 [W] All these costs are accounted for one thing that was incredibly critical, you know to this customer as well was accuracy, right?
01:10:34 [W] So we've talked a little bit about this, you know before but you know in terms of the utilization data, you also want to pull this request information, right? So if somebody has
01:10:38 [W] As a request that's tradition it consistently over there actually usage.
01:10:44 [W] That's what you want to use to allocate because no one else is able to use those resources.
01:10:51 [W] You also want to factor in things like an opinion, you know, all workloads may not be running, you know on all nodes within the cluster.
01:10:59 [W] So that's also critical, you know to make sure that you're bringing in and also, you know true costs here, right?
01:11:02 [W] There are committees discounts running on these resources.
01:11:09 [W] You want to look at all of that in fact it in so you make sure your teams are actually looking at the accurate costs. And then the last thing that I would say before, you know handing it over to Jonathan would be reporting on idol, you know, and so making sure you're looking at the idol.
01:11:23 [W] Is that resources in the cluster, you know providing that to your teams?
01:11:28 [W] This was critical, you know to this organization that I'm talking about, you know and bring that to the teams and give them the data they need to optimize those clusters.
01:11:39 [W] So with that I'd like to thank you very much and I'd like to then hand over to Jonathan to continue the talk. Thanks a lot.
01:11:48 [W] Great.
01:11:51 [W] Thanks, Casey.
01:11:56 [W] Some all sorts of awesome content here.
01:11:57 [W] We have more to come. So I'm going to continue the theme of trying to be concise and keep things on time.
01:12:03 [W] I will also start with a quick.
01:12:04 [W] thank you to Q Khan to the finops foundation and J are not for only putting the finops foundation together, but kicking off this discussion here and inviting Claudel to participate as well as this fantastic panel.
01:12:18 [W] This really is a topic that I think we've
01:12:19 [W] Dean be more and more relevant as organizations not only evolve their finops practices, but of all their applications in parallel, if you like those two things have gone have gained particular
01:12:34 [W] Like couple of years it kind of in parallel, which is interesting and Cloud Health has been enacted the I'm not going to talk too much about Cloud health.
01:12:50 [W] I'm going to kind of take a lens of a lot of stuff that Jr. Sasha Debo Casey talked about around how do you like allocate shared resources, but just in our experience cloud has been doing the kind of this modern app lenses finops for
01:12:58 [W] Is it just trying to take some of that experience and to some key questions we find useful to ask yourself. So with that I'm going to just share a couple sides may be useful for that Dive Right In and then we'll take it from there.
01:13:15 [W] Let me see if I can share my screen.
01:13:18 [W] Okay, great.
01:13:23 [W] So maybe just a quick intro for myself.
01:13:24 [W] I'm a product manager the cloud on the cloud health Team at VMware.
01:13:29 [W] I've been there for about a year before that.
01:13:32 [W] I was actually working on networking and security for modern apps and kubenetes.
01:13:45 [W] And certainly this is kind of a basic framework that Claudel fuses just to help facilitate conversations. And and one of the things I'm looking forward to it the finops bof.
01:13:48 [W] Part of the finops organization is just like Jr.
01:13:53 [W] Said finding that common language may be parts of this evolved.
01:14:02 [W] But what we found helpful is just this kind of Natural Evolution of this reporting is cost allocation.
01:14:02 [W] How do I get that clear visibility?
01:14:05 [W] What am I coughs? My team's cost versus your teams when I look at that highly complex Cloud build and the from there.
01:14:10 [W] How do I optimize? What am I have two positions versus your optimizations?
01:14:14 [W] So on and so forth.
01:14:16 [W] forth. How do I do that as on a regular basis through ongoing governance Automation and has
01:14:18 [W] Kind of five key questions.
01:14:32 [W] I like I like to highlight some of these we've covered but I'm going to kind of also paint the lens of the different disparate teams that we work with here. So
01:14:42 [W] nothing's cookie cutter here.
01:14:47 [W] No to work looked at the same in particular. I think some of these lessons come from just the differences in the challenges as well as the commonalities between a start-up that's Cloud first started with kubernetes.
01:14:57 [W] All your apps are monetized the kinds of challenges. You see there versus a really, you know, let's say a 50,000 person 10,000 person Enterprise that is part of their like Casey said they've got a really mixed environment some Modern apps some more Legacy.
01:15:12 [W] Laughs how to do this all together but across the board.
01:15:20 [W] it's just the first question is what do you want?
01:15:26 [W] What do you want to report on? So we learned in the recent talks about all the options we have to report on them, but what do you actually care about? Right? So I think what we've seen is, you know teams app teams, especially in the startup side.
01:15:35 [W] There are often the ones to start to just wear a lot of hats dig into the finops side of it and say great.
01:15:41 [W] I've got this tool set now I can divvy up my cost. I'm going to
01:15:42 [W] Straight go straight to this.
01:15:46 [W] I like Jr. Said bucket actually use bucket.
01:15:47 [W] Question is what do you want?
01:15:59 [W] What do you want to report on? So we learned in the recent talks about all the options we have to report on them, but what do you actually care about?
01:16:00 [W] Right? So I think what we've seen is, you know teams app teams, especially in the startup side.
01:16:00 [W] They're often the ones to start to just wear a lot of hats dig into the finops side of it as a great.
01:16:01 [W] I've got this tool set now, I can divvy up my cost. I'm going to straight go straight to this.
01:16:02 [W] I like Jr. Said bucket actually use bucket. I consequences not only going
01:16:03 [W] to like a micro service cost bucket, which is very granular right for a lot of organizations can be very granular.
01:16:06 [W] But the reason why this Top Line question is important is what what matters to the rest of the business because I often will see the finance side of the house saying well all I really care at the end of the days how much did this product line cost to me?
01:16:11 [W] Maybe your small organization. You really just focusing on your first product may be a much larger organization.
01:16:14 [W] You've got number of products and really how does that align you can get started without answering us across the country our
01:16:23 [W] But it's going to be a question that's going to keep coming back.
01:16:26 [W] Like what is the language you use within the organization? What are those buckets out of those buckets aligned?
01:16:27 [W] And then that gets to the question of like, okay. Well what metadata we're using those buckets, I'm diving straight to the kubernative example, like Casey said you for a lot of organizations.
01:16:38 [W] It's not just kubernative.
01:16:39 [W] He's it's okay.
01:16:41 [W] How does this line with my tags?
01:16:44 [W] But given our Cube con zooming into the community side even in small teams, but especially in larger Enterprises, you quickly see even just what a cluster means it's you know, it's easy.
01:16:56 [W] caught hell sorry coupon here. There's a lot of talks.
01:16:57 [W] Great best practices, but it's very easy in kubernative, which is so flexible.
01:17:06 [W] And if you so many choices to quickly just use each of these constructs in different ways.
01:17:10 [W] So kind of just painted the picture here because we see this over and over again.
01:17:17 [W] It's like well this team kind of use of clusters and that way this team uses clusters and that way I think more commonly namespace differences and you know, one team using namespace across the team or two or other two other teams using namespace to signify.
01:17:26 [W] You know one team using namespace across the team or to the or other two other teams using namespace to signify like a micro service are my app Centric construct on confusion around.
01:17:34 [W] Oh, well, everybody uses this app label.
01:17:36 [W] We've aligned great.
01:17:37 [W] But what does that actually mean?
01:17:39 [W] Is that a Micro Surface is at the whole application and then of course just the general what are all the other labels you use?
01:17:48 [W] What are some of the can maybe maybe you want like multiple buckets from the last question. What are those?
01:17:52 [W] gets
01:17:53 [W] Casey touchdown this this is another interesting question when we talk about okay specific to the kubernative side.
01:18:07 [W] We're now it also talking about shared resources.
01:18:10 [W] Let's let's just take the compute of my worker nodes that's often. One of the biggest costs generated by kubernative scaling up the big application got lots of worker nodes. Lots of instances vm's whatever they are costing a lot of money.
01:18:22 [W] How do I share that? I've got a pod from one team on the same worker node as a poddisruptionbudgets.
01:18:25 [W] But also on the same note as a pot from another team, how do I divvy that up?
01:18:40 [W] And there's kind of this is may be oversimplifying it but in my I think the whole theme Here is to kind of take this very complex landscape and ask some very simple questions to help guide us in here.
01:18:45 [W] I think the common trade-offs we see our resource requests versus actual usage right so I can see what did what did my workloads my team's workloads ask of kubenetes that then got spun up.
01:18:55 [W] Ask for that for that reason we see a lot of organizations moving are using research requests as that common metric but the flip side is well. What if I asked for my app asked for X X & Y amount of resources but it didn't use them.
01:19:14 [W] I that's not fair.
01:19:16 [W] I want only get charged for what I used but there's there's kind of pros and cons to each side here that I think are worth considering so you can make the right choice for you. For example, what kind of incentive what kind of incentives you want to create cross the development teams or whoever
01:19:29 [W] Is that setting that Jama of those terraform templates or whatever it is?
01:19:38 [W] That's that's configuring your your resource requests.
01:19:41 [W] And by the way, there's tools out there to help you like the vertical poddisruptionbudgets.
01:19:59 [W] Up using that's kind of the Nirvana state, but you never you never in that perfect zone. So what are the incentives you want to set up?
01:20:10 [W] I think you know we see folks thinking about that as they choose which metric to use here.
01:20:12 [W] Coverage on time Jack just a few more minutes here just to wrap up with I won't pass over to web from Q combo.
01:20:20 [W] Question, which actually was covered by the left side of the idle idle time who pays for that. I'll save you time.
01:20:35 [W] also who pays for something like a servicemeshcon.
01:20:59 [W] Doing things is some folks still do that in some ways that that's fine or is it more, you know to the whole point of the finops side? How do we how do we share in kind of allocate?
01:21:10 [W] dynamically some fair from Fair Dynamic allocation of some of these costs and in I call this out as a question because different teams a lot of different answers.
01:21:21 [W] And finally, this is kind of a broader topic than a straightforward question is what am I a number optimization opportunities.
01:21:30 [W] Any of the good news is kubermatic is very flexible.
01:21:36 [W] The bad news is our the challenge side of that is there's a lot of opportunities for Waste.
01:21:40 [W] I mentioned the Pod, you know, the Pod scaling or pot sizing a challenge.
01:21:44 [W] There's also how do you how your auto scaling your nose and your pods?
01:21:49 [W] I think there's plenty of toxic puke on over the past years talking about this practices of operating the planetscale.
01:21:51 [W] For my operating infrastructure auto-scaling.
01:21:57 [W] Today's any of the good news is good man is very flexible.
01:22:00 [W] The bad news is our the challenge side of that is there's a lot of opportunities for Waste.
01:22:00 [W] I mentioned the Pod, you know, the Pod scaling or pot sizing a challenge.
01:22:01 [W] There's also how do you how your auto scaling your nose and your pods?
01:22:02 [W] think there's plenty of toxic puke on over the past years talking about this practices of operating the platform operating infrastructure auto-scaling. There's no direct sizing are using the write node for your if your
01:22:06 [W] Russian and then there's kind of the discount side of the cloud which is a little bit more Finance Centric traditionally is also had to do with infrastructure. If you look at like reserved instances, well, you know, let's take this node, right
01:22:12 [W] Kind of the discount side of the cloud which is a little bit more Finance Centric traditionally has also had to do with infrastructure. If you look at like reserved instances. Well, you know, let's take this node, right sizing example if my notes use M5
01:22:14 [W] Past had to instill in many cases.
01:22:20 [W] Okay, then I've got to go by and 5xo reserved instances.
01:22:27 [W] You see the industry at least AWS starting to dip their toe and in to some extent Google committee use discount saying let's actually decouple the commitments and discount terms from the infrastructure and just say look, your infrastructure is going to change as long as
01:22:36 [W] AWS starting to dip their toe and to some extent Google committee use discount saying let's actually decouple the commitments and discount terms from the infrastructure and just say look, your infrastructure is going to change as long as you commit to my cloud environment and most cases here.
01:22:39 [W] Environment in most cases here.
01:22:41 [W] I'll give you a discount and those because that's often a fine eccentric conversation.
01:22:48 [W] That's very relevant for finops, but maybe isn't always coming up to keep Conn thought I'd kind of build a quick summary of some of the options out there in the industry.
01:22:57 [W] This is far from a perfect table.
01:22:59 [W] It's just kind of to start the discussion kind of summarize those Resources with that wish you all well on your Cloud mature.
01:23:07 [W] T Journeys and I will pass it over to web.
01:23:11 [W] Excellent.
01:23:17 [W] Thanks so much Jonathan and and thanks to everybody for joining today. Thanks to all of our organizers Jr.
01:23:24 [W] And others that helped make this possible.
01:23:29 [W] I'm going to take some time to take a step back and talk about really the major challenges that we see when when teams do this major migration to kubernative and then some of the practical ways that we've seen
01:23:40 [W] And thanks to everybody for joining today.
01:23:41 [W] Thanks to all of our organizers Jr.
01:23:41 [W] And others that helped make this possible.
01:23:42 [W] I'm going to take some time to take a step back and talk about really the major challenges that we see when when teams do this major migration to kubernative and then some of the practical ways that we've seen
01:23:43 [W] Those challenges so with that I'll go ahead and kick off a screen share.
01:23:46 [W] so like Jonathan mentioned, my name is web browser and I'm co-founder and CEO of coop cost really quickly a little bit about us myself and my co-founder previously built infrastructure Monitoring
01:24:06 [W] We worked on external cloud services as well as internal container based infrastructure.
01:24:16 [W] And for the last two years while running cookus we've been exclusively focused on cost visibility and optimization solutions for kubernative Centric infrastructure.
01:24:29 [W] So we provide visibility and help teams with non kubernative cost. But a lot of our users are do have a meaningful kubernative footprint that is oftentimes.
01:24:37 [W] It's growing very quickly.
01:24:40 [W] Our company is based in San Francisco. And we have a distributed engineering team and we have over a thousand of active deployments of coop costs across all the major Cloud providers as well as on-prem even are keptn varmints
01:24:54 [W] From shapes and sizes of you know clusters with or environments with up to you know, 10,000 nodes down to really small environments across all different Industries.
01:25:09 [W] So we feel like we've seen seen a lot in able to learn a lot of best practices during that time.
01:25:18 [W] So our fundamental belief is that with the adoption and migration to kubernative pretty much everything changes with the actual application of a finops.
01:25:24 [W] Soooo, if you haven't read Jr's book, it's actually incredible.
01:25:33 [W] It does an amazing job of kind of underlying or like giving a lot of detail around the underlying finops life cycle around inform optimized and operate and while that life cycle isn't fundamentally changing
01:25:44 [W] that you turn the the technical implementation of recommendations optimizations Etc is rapidly changing and we see that in really three three major areas
01:26:00 [W] Around just new platform extractions features and tools, for example, we've talked a little bit about just the new complexity that the orchestration layer as well as containers adds on top of
01:26:16 [W] BMS with this you're more likely to have multi tenant or shared resources and you're actually more likely to have really Dynamic environment.
01:26:29 [W] So real time or close to real-time information becomes a lot more important.
01:26:36 [W] Secondly if we if we just look at why teams move to kubernative.
01:26:38 [W] He's in the first place. It's really about developer empowerment.
01:26:40 [W] Right?
01:26:45 [W] It's about enabling portability and innate or enabling higher velocity more.
01:26:46 [W] Transparency excetera and what we see is that these Cloud management decisions are not excluded.
01:26:55 [W] It's really about helping developers make the best decision for the broader team organization. And that's about letting them have a decentralized decision making process without overwhelming them.
01:27:08 [W] And then third is we have this rapidly evolving open source, ecosystem around kubernative. He's so outline a couple of solutions like Helm and Prometheus and servicemeshcon like linkerd e and what you see is
01:27:23 [W] That every part of the application life cycle is changing how applications are delivered how they're observed how they're managed on an ongoing basis from a security perspective networking perspective Etc.
01:27:39 [W] And that obviously has has major changes in terms of how you actually manage spin effectively in these new environment.
01:27:47 [W] So with that I'm going to walk through kind of how we see teams actually navigate this and the first is around embracing the right platform features and tools for your organization and where you are in your kubernative journey
01:28:03 [W] Like Jonathan and a couple of others have already mentioned here.
01:28:08 [W] Is that context really matters what you'll see in the early days of kubernative is is that there's tons of options for your team to manage this complexity here just a couple of from a mission controllers to taint.
01:28:21 [W] Two different levels of auto-scaling poddisruptionbudgets staple said you name it.
01:28:28 [W] It's a really long list and and what we see in just over and over again is that again context really matters one example that I give that we see regularly is this notion of establishing
01:28:43 [W] Whether that's as an individual developer as a team Etc what we see oftentimes as a really small team that's just starting with kubernetes.
01:28:57 [W] It may be okay to not have owners right the team small enough to know who owns this cluster or even this name space etcetera, but then as that grows, you may rely more and more on say namespace annotations or namespace labels.
01:29:09 [W] As that grows, you may need to get more granular because teams and departments and project sizes are growing.
01:29:25 [W] You may move to say controller level invitations. And then finally, you may work your way all the way up to a mission controllers, which is kind of like a gatekeeper for individual workloads that will enforce or require an owner whether it
01:29:31 [W] He more a Project Lead Etc.
01:29:36 [W] So I think that's just one example where we see oftentimes the solution depends on again your organization and where you are in this journey.
01:29:48 [W] So second again about really empowering Engineers to make great decisions in this area and it starts by kind of understanding, you know, the day-to-day here and it's that as developers were constantly overwhelmed.
01:29:57 [W] and we've got you know a hundred things going on at once so really being super targeted with both the requirements as well as the recommendations and insights that you are delivering to developers
01:30:12 [W] And and secondly to really enable developers.
01:30:16 [W] we've seen that by bringing data to work flows and tools that they already use in their day-to-day can make this a lot easier for them to make great decisions here one example is using our metrics
01:30:31 [W] Or other metrics to be writing ravana right teams regularly a looking at utilization data and other data in you know, some workloads that they're already leveraging and that could be Griffon or something else.
01:30:46 [W] So trying to pipe cost as JRM engine as a first class citizen right next to that that existing data and then third is again really about embracing this growing and oftentimes transparent ecosystem a lot of this
01:30:58 [W] Round the cncf just see tons of new like opportunities for teams to have more control and more focus on just privacy security flexibility Etc.
01:31:14 [W] and ultimately, you know, this is about again giving developers the right tools at the right time to to manage spend effectively one example is seeing teams leverage open source
01:31:30 [W] Missions like Prometheus and alert managers alert manager to streamline their process for seeing and then acting on real-time cost data through budget alerts etcetera.
01:31:45 [W] So we've seen a lot of teams just be really Successful by deeply integrating into kind of the growing open source ecosystem here.
01:31:57 [W] We've actually taken a very similar approach with our product. All of our product is built on open source open Court ruling
01:32:01 [W] and just see that as a great opportunity for for this ecosystem to have more transparency and more control as time goes on. So in summary here really quickly.
01:32:14 [W] We do think that kubernative brings a lot of new complexity.
01:32:20 [W] we also think that the tools and Frameworks the manage this complexity are arriving as well and we're incredibly optimistic about it as a as a platform and a broader community and ecosystem in terms of
01:32:30 [W] Ultimately driving costs down while also giving all these great benefits like faster delivery portability etcetera Etc. So please reach out. If you want to learn more happy to help any way we can we love talking
01:32:45 [W] Stuff, so thank you again. I'll turn it over to Jay are now 4 for Q&A.
01:32:50 [W] Fantastic.
01:32:54 [W] Thank you everybody.
01:32:55 [W] It was great to see very similar talk tracks through this even though we didn't all see each other slides ahead of time.
01:33:03 [W] So clearly all focusing on the right right areas in the space.
01:33:06 [W] So we're going to do about 10 minutes of Q&A now and I've taken a few questions that have come in if you want to put more in the chat, please do that and we'll kind of go through these and feel free speakers are going to pass one to
01:33:18 [W] You but then you know others if you want to join and let me know.
01:33:22 [W] So let's start with Sasha and Sasha you came up and sort of a devops engineering Centric world and have only sort of a more recently sort of in the last year to gotten into this financial side of things. You know, can you speak a little bit?
01:33:36 [W] Question come up, which was you know how finops is related devops and Dev seccomp.
01:34:05 [W] The conference in Las Vegas in Mike Fuller's class actually and when he was describing finops, I kept making this internal Connection in my head two concepts and principles from
01:34:20 [W] More from agile and from devops and where I saw intersect very clearly for me was on the concept of responsibility and control and bringing together teams.
01:34:35 [W] So for those of you who are you know, the two people who haven't heard of devops on the call, like just to reiterate like the principles there are that, you know,
01:34:42 [W] it's a collaborative culture made up of you know, different teams that come together to deliver the product the the problems that we were trying to solve with devops were around speed of delivery, and we previously
01:34:58 [W] Sleep would have two separate teams that we would be responsible for getting code into production.
01:35:05 [W] You would have an operations team and development team and it's sometimes a QA team as well. And you know, they would Ascend the product in production serially, and they all had different kinds of responsibilities and its own companies you had different
01:35:19 [W] Teams reporting two different VPS who are all responsible for this now. The problem was that when there were issues. They would all point fingers at each other and developers couldn't have access to production either to solve things quickly by collapsing everyone onto the same
01:35:34 [W] Him by recognizing that it's collaboration and that we needed to give developers more responsibility for their for their product.
01:35:46 [W] We were able to solve that problem and so finops is collaborative by default.
01:35:50 [W] It's bringing together Finance procurement and Engineering into a conversation where they are all needed to actually make the right decision and it gives developers that degree of control that they always wanted. They have a cloud a
01:36:04 [W] API and they can deploy it well, but along with that is the corresponding responsibility of managing your spent and being aware that cost is a dimension of your applications responsibility. So that's sort of
01:36:19 [W] How I see the two intersecting and combining for me, they are simply extensions of the agile Concepts.
01:36:26 [W] Yeah, fantastic.
01:36:32 [W] I found that when we were writing the interest to finops in the book.
01:36:34 [W] I just kept finding quotes from you know, the the agile Manifesto and those areas that were just resonating so much.
01:36:44 [W] It was really really cool to see all this intersection point. So that's that's very much ethos of it.
01:36:45 [W] Awesome.
01:36:46 [W] So next question.
01:36:48 [W] I'm going to pass this one to web and there been a few questions around this area of allocating costs within kubernative A's people have asked you know, what's the best way to
01:36:58 [W] To map cost to an app team or shared cluster.
01:37:02 [W] You know, what do you map to maybe just summarize that is like, you know, what?
01:37:11 [W] What do you see as the most common mistakes? Maybe that people make when trying to figure out that allocation strategy, where do they start? Where should they be looking in the beginning?
01:37:14 [W] Yeah, it's a great question.
01:37:22 [W] I think it really hits on everything we've talked about today right there.
01:37:24 [W] There is lots of new complexity here and and oftentimes it's non-trivial to navigate and manage.
01:37:37 [W] I think if I could summarize I think the biggest mistake or challenge we make is teams kind of not taking the time to disseminate the why the and really think through
01:37:44 [W] through as a broader team the Y and that can be why are we allocating shared resources the way we are or why are we allocating Idol cost the way we are and why are we building on the maximum of requests and
01:37:58 [W] Lean on the maximum of requests and usage and not just usage.
01:38:02 [W] So I think taking the time and having a process and a set of tools to clearly communicate that allocation kind of reasoning throughout the organization leads to much better adoption by n and ultimately,
01:38:15 [W] Ultimately, you know accountability and optimization.
01:38:18 [W] Fantastic.
01:38:29 [W] Yeah, that's always the hardest challenge. I think of anything else process is getting that allocation strategy, right? Because without it you don't actually have accountability people say that's not my resource. Awesome. So I'll pass this one to get to Casey we've gotten I've been collecting trying to merge questions three or
01:38:36 [W] My resource awesome, so I'll pass this 22 Casey we've gotten I've been collecting trying to merge questions three or four around the aspect of optimization sort of we were talking inside the containers, but what about outside of them, right?
01:38:43 [W] So of the resources of you know reservations or savings plans scaling of those, can you speak a little bit to the aspect of how you start to think about optimizing the infrastructure and the associated programs in relation to kubernative?
01:38:57 [W] Yeah, so thank that I think there's in webct at it some of these as well.
01:39:09 [W] So I think I generally think about this in maybe three different fronts here, right?
01:39:16 [W] So we've got the concept of cluster right sizing so, you know, the underlying nodes are they the right size we have the right amount of them.
01:39:20 [W] them. There's some help you can get with the auto scalars, you know, in terms of that. We also you know web management is as well the concept of requests over usage right and believe it or not.
01:39:30 [W] Will you know using kubernative we still see a lot of over-provisioning it'll be some the data that we see right. So so kind of tracking that you know request over usage if it's consistent, you know over a period of time. There's clearly some changes you can make and while there may
01:39:43 [W] You know, the underlying nodes are they the right size we have the right amount of them.
01:39:44 [W] There's some help you can get with the auto scalars, you know, in terms of that. We also, you know web management as well the concept of requests over usage right and believe it or not still, you know, using communities.
01:39:45 [W] We still see a lot of over-provisioning.
01:39:46 [W] it'll be some of the data that we see right so so kind of tracking that you know request over usage if it's consistent, you know over a period of time. There's clearly some changes you can make
01:39:49 [W] Make and while there may not be some you know, immediate cost savings may be that just increases the idol bucket, right, you know, then gives you an opportunity to further scale those underlying resources, right?
01:39:57 [W] And then the last one which you touched on they are but is you know that what I would call Financial optimization so each each cloud provider, you know, whether it's our eyes savings plans communities discounts, you know gives you instruments, you know to save probably the most
01:40:08 [W] Reese has the idol bucket, right, you know, then gives you an opportunity to further scale those those underlying resources, right?
01:40:10 [W] And then the last one which you touched on they are but is you know that what I would call Financial optimization so each cloud provider, you know, whether it's our eyes savings plans communities discounts, you know gives you instruments, you know to save probably the most
01:40:10 [W] You know, so doing good financial planning, you know in looking at historical usage and understanding where you want to make those commitments is really critical to getting the optimal.
01:40:27 [W] You know, I would say cost that you can get for any workload that you're running whether it's kubenetes or not.
01:40:30 [W] It introduces an interesting set of optimization challenges in within optimization challenges.
01:40:38 [W] It's a little bit of inception happening when you start to factor in all those things cool. So awesome.
01:40:45 [W] Let's do one for you.
01:40:57 [W] You all sort of touched a bit on this and it's come up in a few different variations in the questions of the strategy for dealing with unallocated and idler wasted costs.
01:40:58 [W] You know, what have you seen Ben, you know, they're splitting it evenly or based on usage.
01:41:04 [W] Sure absorbed by Central team. What have you seen sort of been the either the most popular or common ones or the their conversations that need to happen or to decide what to do with those costs?
01:41:12 [W] Yeah, it's a good question.
01:41:26 [W] Well, I think you know just product management hat when we were doing this discovery with customers few years ago. And as kind of persisted the resource, I talked about this a little bit the resource
01:41:31 [W] Model became very attractive because it kind of automatically takes care of this problem doesn't have other but it has other caveats, right? So if teams kind of like squeezing workloads without research request will that also has to be managed there's some tools and
01:41:46 [W] Godlike default resource requests which really help with that but we've actually seen this as a customer preferred organization preferred model to just incentivize the right to write operations of kubenetes and how teams all plug into communities.
01:42:02 [W] The write operations of kubenetes and how teams all plug into communities that said.
01:42:11 [W] I do see this evolving now and folks saying well, maybe a want to like in this other app and this environment.
01:42:14 [W] I still get that all that logic and all those trade-offs nevertheless.
01:42:18 [W] I want to just split and see exactly what this app costs based on exactly how much resources it used and I think you know there continue to be ongoing questions. Well, what about the rest of us?
01:42:27 [W] Stuff maybe just goes to the bu rights not of that team, but it's not like Central either.
01:42:35 [W] It's like maybe some like interim like mid-tier group if that makes sense, you know, so it's not like like my product team that works on it, but it's also not a central it team for the whole company.
01:42:47 [W] It's like whatever whatever be you or your team reports into I've seen that maybe become attractive for that.
01:42:54 [W] So it still has some business context carried with those idle resources, but but not penalizing the
01:42:59 [W] Jules
01:43:00 [W] and excited sounds like most things in finops early things.
01:43:04 [W] There's not one right answer.
01:43:06 [W] It depends on the organization.
01:43:10 [W] We one more question and then we'll wrap it right up on time.
01:43:11 [W] There was a question around open source, tooling for this work for enforcing governance and tagging one of the systems. We looked at in a foundation did presentation ovhcloud custodian Sasha or anywhere else. Can you share some context
01:43:25 [W] the type of tooling
01:43:27 [W] Yeah, I mean I would give it up to web and like we we love using his tool.
01:43:35 [W] I'd also suggest that you can take a look at live ramps open source tooling as well.
01:43:45 [W] We open source K DT which allows you to param it dries your kublr cluster settings.
01:43:50 [W] We've released that into the wild as well. And then there is a finops for engineers channel in the finops foundation slack group as well. So that is a great place to learn about what's available for a developer.
01:43:58 [W] Excellent. And unless the engineers cut me off.
01:44:09 [W] I'm going to keep asking questions because I went for Debo to if anybody wants to stay on a little bit longer and know we're up on time Debo.
01:44:18 [W] Can you speak a little bit to the challenges of sort of combining usage data and cost data and gke and sort of what what you know, things are people are likely to run into when they start this journey of trying to understand their container costs.
01:44:24 [W] Yeah, I mean it's been such a little bit by by some of the other colleagues that we've had talking here. But when it comes to combine and usage data and cost eight, I think what people are particularly looking most to do is to say okay at what level do I really want to label my
01:44:39 [W] So that I can make sure that the costs are clear on the other side.
01:44:46 [W] We've been dealing with a little bit of an alpha here on our side to take some of the uses that people are used to seeing because I'm a lot of cases.
01:44:57 [W] They're used to seeing the GCE costs for the gke for example and lining those up with cluster so they can see them in their bigquery export but the easiest way to get the most value out of that at least for that tool is to make sure that they've labeled there.
01:45:08 [W] Jen's appropriately with the cost centers the Department's whatever they have. So from that aspect labeling their usage so that it makes sense. In terms of the cost containers that they ultimately want to see has been a big thing that people should
01:45:24 [W] We'll be releasing some some tools in the very near future to help deal with that.
01:45:33 [W] So thinking about that early. The second part of it is again. The request first is consumption utilization.
01:45:40 [W] That's something that people won't be familiar with at first, but once they really get going and get more mature they're going to be wanting to look at right and since we know that you're getting billed based on your requests, but your utilization is actually what you're responsible for
01:45:52 [W] Always want to make sure that you're not inflicting, you know cost pain on your great organization, right?
01:46:07 [W] So if you know yourself that you're not necessarily you doing is utilizing as much as you're requesting you may be doing that on purpose because you want to have that that capability there when you need it, but if you know, your workloads are fairly stable you want to see
01:46:14 [W] Don't work you can do right. So I think those two big things labeling and uses optimization versus request optimization have been the big sticking points for people getting started.
01:46:26 [W] So let me yeah, it's been fascinating to see that injection of new level of beta into this problem.
01:46:39 [W] So we are officially well over time and I'm told we actually need to wrap up someone to thank everybody for joining especially speakers and everyone who asked questions.
01:46:47 [W] If you ask a question that we didn't get to we're going to try and chase them asynchronously afterwards a couple things to think about for later today.
01:46:55 [W] today is finops day we've decided so we have another event happening later today that is specifically
01:46:57 [W] You on AWS Savings Plan strategy, you can find out more about that on the finops that work blog going to follow that with one on CD strategy and Azure our only strategy as well.
01:47:12 [W] So if you want to get involved with that or join the slack or connect with any of the folks here or the 2000 practitioners definitely go over to finops dot-org where you can get signed up and hopefully we'll see you as part of the conversations.
01:47:21 [W] move forward. So thank you Debo Sasha Casey Jonathan and web will be a pleasure and for
01:47:27 [W] Everybody who joined appreciate your your time and questions.
01:47:31 [W] Have a great day.
