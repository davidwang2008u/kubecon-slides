00:01:07 [W] Hello, so Bill and I are going to talk about a great project called Melody in this project. We use open source to build the platform for Federated learning which is used in the context of the project
00:08:14 [W] to accelerate drug discovery
00:08:16 [W] So Gil if you want to present yourself, yeah, so I'm Bill Mulligan and I work at kubermatic which is a company that works on Multi cluster management for automation of it operations in the cloud native technology space.
00:08:36 [W] And then give me my knee. I woke a token.
00:08:42 [W] It's a startup founded three years ago.
00:08:46 [W] We do machine learning to help medical research in the middle of the project. We are project coordinator and we also develop the application layer of the platform of fidelity learning which we are going to present
00:08:59 [W] as a start which is military military is a project which is funded by the European commission and the European Federation of pharmaceutical
00:09:18 [W] And that's what seasons so it's an I am a project for those. We are familiar with these types of projects.
00:09:30 [W] The goal of the project is to apply Fidelity learning for drug Discovery with data from 10 pharmaceutical companies.
00:09:40 [W] So you can see the logo of these pharmaceutical companies and on the slide.
00:09:42 [W] There are responsible for preparing the data and also providing the data in the Consortium.
00:09:53 [W] There are also what we call public partners because they are pretty friendly and the responsible bill for building and also for operating the platform of fidelity drawing in particular. There is loodse now
00:10:05 [W] My cheek which takes care of sitting up the infra and and looking in which takes care of the application layer and
00:10:20 [W] For this we use open source Solutions so key domestic uses kubermatic and at Okinawa music in Connect, which is based on an open source framework subscribe.
00:10:31 [W] It's a project which started one year ago and it's going to last two more years.
00:10:40 [W] So, why do we want to build such a platform of Federated longing for drug Discovery as a disclaimer?
00:10:55 [W] I'm not a chemist, but I try to explain on average bringing one drug to market cost bit less than 2 billion euros and takes a certain areas.
00:11:05 [W] So it's a lot and and when of the step correspond to drug Discovery typically pharmaceutical company
00:11:15 [W] we did a lot of asses chicken with a specific molecules interact with specific targets for teens, and it takes a lot of time and and and a lot of money so
00:11:30 [W] Every farmer has a library of annotated molecules of these data sets and this library is very precious for Farmer.
00:11:44 [W] They have patterns with minimal deterrence. So for them, it's a key asset key competitive asset.
00:11:47 [W] And in the recent years machine learning has been proven very efficient to do to accelerate the drug Discovery part during a screening process
00:12:04 [W] Cuba's it
00:12:05 [W] and the in the recent years machine learning has been proven very efficient to do to accelerate the drug Discovery part doing a screening process.
00:12:06 [W] keeps cleaning process
00:12:07 [W] Emilio G.
00:12:14 [W] We want to show the benefits of building a machine learning models using data from the set of the different pharmaceutical companies to see if we can use our goal of the project.
00:12:24 [W] So but in order to do this, we need to build a platform and this platform is based on one hand down my cheek and on the other hand you can connect so I'm going to start with
00:12:36 [W] it
00:12:38 [W] so it corresponds to the to the application layer of the of the platform and and it makes it possible to do Federated learning.
00:12:51 [W] But what is Fidelity learning? So as just mentioned each farmer has its own label you of annotated molecule and we want to train a machine learning model with the
00:13:08 [W] zettaset of gin different pharmaceutical companies
00:13:13 [W] so training model on multiple data sources, the standard approach would be to pull all the data in one Center and try and train machine learning models there.
00:13:29 [W] But in the context of Madrid's absolutely not possible because as you just mentioned is very competitive data and it's a very sensitive data because it's competitive data so far more companies don't want to share
00:13:40 [W] to share their data with competitors
00:13:44 [W] So it's not possible to do this putting up data.
00:13:48 [W] And another approach is to let the data remain to let the data stored in pharmaceutical centers and the make the machine learning model travel from one Center to another
00:14:05 [W] And to let the data stored in pharmaceutical centers and the next machine learning model travel from one Center to another in order to be trained and this is what we call Fidelity drowning more
00:14:10 [W] And this is what we call Fidelity drawing more precisely in order to train a model with the skin.
00:14:15 [W] We would train the model train different model in parallel on the data of every each farmer Center then we would aggregate the output model
00:14:29 [W] The mood that dispatcher so it's a specific application.
00:14:40 [W] And then these aggregated model is sent back to the different farmer centers the training continues then it's aggregated again and so on and so forth. So this is what's Confederate emblem.
00:14:49 [W] And the to do so a token with build a solution, which is called you can connect it's built around two key features.
00:15:04 [W] So the first one is data privacy and we deal with a very sensitive data. So we want to make sure that no properties of the data can go out of the Pharma Center.
00:15:16 [W] In the second feature is present by DT because we believe that traceability bring trust between partners that don't trust themselves each other and also because traceability makes it possible to
00:15:31 [W] The real sensitive data, so we want to make sure that new properties of the data can go out of the Family Center.
00:15:32 [W] And the second feature is press ability because we believe that traceability between trust between partners that don't trust themselves each other and also because traceability makes it possible to
00:15:33 [W] It's so so it's something that is key in our context.
00:15:36 [W] And okey you can connect is built with an open car approaching. We use open source, the open-source framework which is called subscribe, which was also developed at okay.
00:15:49 [W] And on top of these open girl, we develop proprietary layers such as techniques to protect modded machine learning models, but also some tools to G Brasilia application more easily.
00:16:06 [W] The open graph subscribe makes it possible to set up a network of nodes or so.
00:16:18 [W] so. It's not kubenetes none, but it's an application and it's a makes it possible to do the orcas orchestration of the training on data, which are distributed.
00:16:27 [W] and on top of these open courses are we have charged to deploy the melody platform because everything runs on kubernative and some tools such as the secure.i purgation, which is a specific technique
00:16:45 [W] Is that models cannot leave data properties outside of medical for the farmer company servers?
00:16:56 [W] so
00:17:03 [W] this is the overview of the application layer once it is deployed.
00:17:10 [W] So basically there is an application deployment under kubernative cluster in every farmer and also in application which is deployed and called Moodle dispatcher in each
00:17:23 [W] Data, and the data are going to be a woman's house and not going to go outside of the application.
00:17:32 [W] And we train a machine learning model on this data by exchanging Zoom model a date with a model dispatcher and doing the orchestration of the training.
00:17:44 [W] It's made possible through two networks.
00:17:50 [W] So the first networks correspond to the to the what is a group represented in blue it correspond to a changes of model of dates, which is done through a classic.
00:18:01 [W] rest API and the second node Network correspond to what is called non-sensitive metadata Network corresponding to the a changes of non-sensitive metadata used to okay?
00:18:16 [W] Great the training of the modem.
00:18:18 [W] And for this we use this discriminated Ledger technology, which is open source, and which is hyperedge of fabric.
00:18:28 [W] So using the application we can submit what is called compute plans.
00:18:42 [W] So it corresponds to the set of training a delegation and evaluation task.
00:18:52 [W] when she's done on the mood energy Spectra and it's up to the data scientist to Define how to train the model to which algorithm is used and which I'd relation to use so that you can
00:19:09 [W] Safer for algorithm. So it's up to the data scientist. And in the middle of the project is done by your partner, which is K KU leuven.
00:19:19 [W] So before letting buildpacks and kubermatic, this is an overview of the architecture of connect. So it's another just an overview basically in
00:19:37 [W] summer Center, so it's called not here, but it's not kubernative not we deploy to begin construct the Subscribe button, which is responsible for managing training tasks and
00:19:53 [W] follows - manage users to rate of data and these begin interacts with non-sensitive meta Data Network enables who hype elaj of fabric in order to exchange non-sensitive metadata about
00:20:09 [W] Initially all new Moodle and the set of statues of the difference of the complete plan and through these are meta Data Network and then there are some tools to interact with
00:20:25 [W] Treasure SDK impossible based on is the gate and the command line application.
00:20:33 [W] So everything is deployed on kubernative using the solution of which is going to present to be presented by Bill. I'm going to switch
00:20:43 [W] cool. Thanks a lot of introduction.
00:20:49 [W] Yeah.
00:20:57 [W] So what I'm going to talk about now is how we use the kubermatic kubenetes platform to deploy and manage the kubernative Clusters that are supporting of the Federated learning both the
00:21:04 [W] Irrigation point from Oakland and the actual like models themselves while still keeping each of the data the data from each of the former partners secure and private in their own accounts.
00:21:22 [W] And so the way that we actually do that is actually by running kubernative use in kubernative. He's and so the advantage that this allows us to do is to actually be able to
00:21:35 [W] deploy and manage clusters from a centralized location without actually having access to any of the accounts because what each one of the farmers farming Partners really cares about is
00:21:50 [W] Privacy around their data because that's their most secure and valuable intellectual property.
00:22:03 [W] So they need a way to ensure that they have complete control over that data.
00:22:10 [W] So the model is to First deploy a kubernative cluster using Cube 1 which is our open source tool for communities cluster like lifecycle management
00:22:18 [W] posture and so what this allows us to do is to create a single highly available kubernative cluster running in in a cap in AWS account controlled by us
00:22:34 [W] We're going to do in that account is then go in and deploy our both kubermatic kubernative Pot Farm which will provision all the Clusters in all of the centralized services.
00:22:49 [W] So like the gitlab instance that were using the aggregation layer to be able to manage the data in the model across all the former accounts.
00:23:02 [W] And so what kubermatic communities pot for Ms. Is really just a set of kubernative operators that
00:23:05 [W] puss actually provision and control the cluster state in an automated fashion and it's built in similar to option kubernative.
00:23:15 [W] He's we're has like an API controller a UI and all the concepts from it are able to be managed by just Cube cuddle itself.
00:23:29 [W] And so what we're actually going to do is from this centralized service.
00:23:35 [W] Stir and service account provision be able to provision kubernative clusters into each of the farmer Partners AWS account. So keeping all the accounts and all the data separate while still providing an ability
00:23:49 [W] Coordinate the training of the model. And so what we can do with kubermatic is spin up multiple, like communities clusters one is for like our Central cluster services that is running
00:24:05 [W] Station Service, like the gitlab instances and the other part is to actually create clusters in the farmer a partner so that they can actually run the machine learning bottles.
00:24:20 [W] And so what this allows us to do is to have a simplified way to manage the communities custard life cycle across all these different accounts and the great thing about being able to Leverage
00:24:32 [W] Is really the whole promise of the cloud native ecosystem that we have one consistent way to run and manage applications running on infrastructure anywhere.
00:24:48 [W] So actually when we began this project, we're actually thinking we were going to do a hybrid approach running some of the stuff in the cloud and some of the stuff on premise and that's how we really came to the idea that we needed to
00:25:00 [W] is to begin with because what kubenetes really gives us is one consistent way a clear API and clear contracts to run applications where ever we want them to go whether that would be
00:25:16 [W] In the cloud or on-premise and we have ended up just like running all of our stuff in the cloud, but it's still using kubernative still gives us the ability to run can workloads.
00:25:32 [W] In the same way across all these different applications different accounts.
00:25:40 [W] It's rather than having to worry about inconsistencies. We have a clear abstraction layer to be able to run our workloads and deliver on this and so we kind of look at this project as a whole so some of the benefits of
00:25:54 [W] On this and so we kind of look at this project as a whole so some of the benefits of using open source in both kubermatic communities platform Oaken and kubernative
00:26:00 [W] open source in both kubermatic communities platform bokken and kubernative use as a whole is that we can do that the code is available and it can be freely shared and for the audited
00:26:10 [W] That the code is available and it can be freely shared and for the audited by all of our partners since all the former partners are very concerned about their IP the ability to review the source code and
00:26:19 [W] Is very important to them because they don't want to run on trusted software on their actual systems.
00:26:31 [W] The second part is the objection of Open Source software.
00:26:43 [W] Is that really anybody can use it and run it wherever they want to so it really creates a consistent way for us to create and deploy both infrastructure on the software across all of the companies. It's not something that's
00:26:48 [W] Bleep, but it can be used in the consistent way across all of our partners. The next part is we can run the same software without having to run on the same infrastructure.
00:27:04 [W] So if you wanted to in the future some of the models that were looking at is being able to run in private data centers or be able to run in different Cloud providers and the great thing about using like open source.
00:27:17 [W] is that it can be we can
00:27:19 [W] Can use it wherever we want so we can actually use the same model the same software again without having to run it on the exact same infrastructure.
00:27:29 [W] So we're not tied into like a single vendor and we're able to protect from malicious actors because of the ability to audit open source Community or anything you'd like to add
00:27:43 [W] For the benefits of using the open-source community.
00:27:47 [W] Yet another those are Prince's that having our code is open source makes it possible to benefit from the contribution of the open source community and it's something that is very valuable for
00:28:08 [W] From the contribution of the open source community and it's something that is very valuable for for the project.
00:28:11 [W] I definitely agree. If you just look at the growth in the power of the community of the kubernative projects is really powered by the community.
00:28:22 [W] So be able to leverage open source software allows us to leverage that Community, too.
00:28:26 [W] And so the cool thing about this project is because it's not tied to a specific industry is that we're actually looking to leverage this project in other Industries.
00:28:44 [W] So other industries that have the problem of machine learning with help them solve some of their problems if they could collaborate on their data to improve the performance, but that the data is actually still there
00:28:55 [W] Just some of the examples of insurance like can we create better risk models Logistics of how do we like efficiently route stuff around the world or Finance how it would predict risk and markets and if we can be able to effectively
00:29:11 [W] To competitively collaborate through the power of Open Source software, like kubernative kubermatic communities platform and open connect.
00:29:24 [W] We really have the ability to change what is possible in the industry.
00:29:28 [W] So if you'd like to contact other people in the Consortium, so both of our contact info is on here, please feel free to reach out if you want to contact the project directly.
00:29:47 [W] Or interests. Please contact the project coordinators either on the public side with Matthew a token or the farmer Lee Davis huguot Hugo.
00:29:58 [W] Who's that Jansen? And with that we'd really like to say thank you to all of our partners around the world.
00:30:08 [W] I think to me how many people are actually involved in the project.
00:30:13 [W] I think it's over a hundred at this point. So it's not just one person who's making this papen. It's really
00:30:19 [W] I like the power of the community this making this project stop it and I'm really excited to see like the results of our first yearly run and really see how this can help transform the process of drug discovery.
00:30:32 [W] Hello.
00:30:53 [W] So the first question was what is trust responsibility and so I'm gonna go back to the slide.
00:31:01 [W] So trust responsibility is a tragedy without the need to rely on one one organization only meaning that
00:31:12 [W] So I think it was in this slide.
00:31:17 [W] It's mention here.
00:31:21 [W] So and as you can see on this slide, there is no organization.
00:31:26 [W] I mean no account on the platform which is responsible for administrating all the nodes and fostering database with all the operations that are going to occur on the
00:31:39 [W] Most specifically in the project will use a distributed Ledger technology.
00:31:49 [W] So and for this we use hype elaj of fabric, which is an open source framework of a distributed Ledger technology and and using this technology.
00:31:58 [W] We don't need to rely or no one organization being responsible for the traceability.
00:32:04 [W] And maybe I can jump in for the next question that we have here, which is so does each farmer partner uses its compute power or power or do they share compute infrastructure?
00:32:25 [W] So, uh Carmen partner is actually running their own machines.
00:32:29 [W] They're coming in completely separate at AWS accounts. So the only sharing is of the model between each Corner partner. So the actual compute power is individual to each farmer because obviously you want
00:32:42 [W] Their scenes where the code is actually running and where the data is actually stored separate from each other.
00:32:46 [W] So each one is individual.
00:32:47 [W] And then it looks like the next question is have you applied this model to Health Data?
00:32:59 [W] So things like patient data for cancer research can be maybe you want to take this one.
00:33:03 [W] And although the platform in itself.
00:33:18 [W] So if the question was what the machine learning models that is created using this platform.
00:33:21 [W] We don't really know what it is used for mean we just know that it is used for drug Discovery. But but then we don't know more about what's on my partner's do with it.
00:33:34 [W] Question was about the platform. And I mean without we apply the pretzel use a platform for user use cases.
00:33:42 [W] Yes, we do and especially we deploy the platform in a speech in hospitals and in order to to work with passion that data and the light for cancer research.
00:33:55 [W] and people have been okay, so there is a next one was a single related question any public academic research use case using this model,
00:34:13 [W] If bimodal me can you meant the platform?
00:34:27 [W] Yes, it is used and it is used by hospitals and and and research centers in France.
00:34:30 [W] But but if you talking about the machine learning model, so it's something that belongs to pharmaceutical companies. And and so there is no access for Beaker or academic partners.
00:34:46 [W] and then the next one can you provide examples of I think it's sensitive and uncensored of data which things like Pharma industry leaders sharing which ones they rather would not so in
00:35:05 [W] contacts that this project what they're looking at and trying to keep private is they have kind of like a whole like libraries like the activity of certain molecules, so they're going to run full
00:35:22 [W] Praise of different molecules and they want to know how they react to different antigens it within your body.
00:35:33 [W] And so they can look at the specific molecules and kind of like their activity profile and stats kind of like the sensitive data that they're trying to keep separate it is like how important or how good is that molecule for attaching to
00:35:46 [W] Is right if it's really good at attaching through three targets and it's a good candidate for a drug. If it's a good candidate for drugging you want to patent it. You don't want other people to know about that until you have a patent and you can make money off of it.
00:36:02 [W] it. So things about the sensitive data is usually things that can be turned into in the case of farmers like some towards Sometimes some type of drug or drug Target.
00:36:16 [W] Maybe it for me.
00:36:23 [W] How do you prevent the Pharma company from being a bad actor and providing falsely labeled data can be maybe you want to take this to that's kind of what open does.
00:36:35 [W] Yeah, so it's a difficult question and the answer really difficult question and it's a key aspect of the project and in order to make sure that farmer companies do not provide
00:36:45 [W] Label data can be maybe you want to take this for that's kind of what open does.
00:36:46 [W] Yeah, so it's a difficult question and the answer really difficult question and it's a key aspect of the project. And in order to make sure that farmer companies do not provide that data
00:36:47 [W] What we do is that we evaluate the machine learning models on the test data set and we do it reduce. We do this kind of regularly and in order to
00:37:01 [W] Ali and in order to check whether the performance of the results of the performance of the model is not the same energy so different partners and and and more precisely I mean
00:37:11 [W] and the and more precisely I mean we also build a machine learning model, which is not building a Federated with a feather edge learning approach just being run with data of the different partners using
00:37:23 [W] Just technology.
00:37:27 [W] We are shows that it's the same data and by comparing the performance is of the community partner models of Federated learning model and the single partner model. We are able kind of infer
00:37:40 [W] Emmett but but it's a good it's a difficult.
00:37:48 [W] It's okay expect under difficult point.
00:37:51 [W] Since I was a question, what is that giri's mm the same across farmer organizations.
00:37:58 [W] Yes.
00:37:58 [W] They are the same.
00:38:03 [W] So it's the same algorithms but but models which are created and are not the same because they are created not exactly with the same data.
00:38:09 [W] So the next question, I think it's for you Bill.
00:38:16 [W] Yes, sir, communities and communities see our DS leverage any of the existing open source libraries are Frameworks.
00:38:29 [W] So I think this is relating to kubermatic kubernative spok form and how the actual platform works.
00:38:35 [W] so what it is using is kubernative operators, and actually all the code is open source on GitHub. So if
00:38:40 [W] Look up kubermatic on GitHub. You can find actually all the code there for both Cube 1 and for kubermatic, so it is all open source of you can find it.
00:38:54 [W] And if you have any questions or need like links to it, please feel free to reach out to me on the cncf slack.
00:38:58 [W] I'm always happy to answer questions.
00:38:59 [W] With different parameters, so we call a machine learning model the output of the training of not Grissom on data.
00:39:25 [W] And and so we use the same hyper part of the stem hyperparameters for the different models, but we combine models
00:39:34 [W] Twins are different partners and the Soul having the same parameters that are trained during the theater lights running optimization.
00:39:47 [W] And then there is another path which is a really private and this one has different parameters for the different pharmaceutical companies.
00:39:51 [W] Will the slides be available?
00:40:02 [W] If so where I can find them in the session agenda.
00:40:05 [W] So I think I did upload them to the session before the talk. But if they're not there, I'll make sure that they are after this talk or if there's problems getting them.
00:40:18 [W] Please feel free to message me too, but they should already actually be on the Yukon platform.
00:40:24 [W] Are there more questions that we have?
00:40:32 [W] I think you've answered all the questions in the chat so far.
00:41:00 [W] I'm also available on Twitter.
00:41:11 [W] Also, my email is just bill. I could not adopt calm.
00:41:15 [W] I'm always happy to chat if you have questions about the project.
00:41:15 [W] And I'm community of anything else to say.
00:41:29 [W] nothing to add some so maybe he has thank you for letting us a presence is a project and also many things towards the different partners of the project and
00:41:48 [W] As in fatigue, so thanks everybody for joining today.
