00:02:45 [W] Good afternoon.
00:02:51 [W] Thanks for coming to this talk.
00:02:53 [W] My name is Yong pal.
00:02:56 [W] I'm a mentor of coding as project.
00:02:58 [W] This is my GitHub handle young Town.
00:03:05 [W] By the way in case you have any questions or you want to reach out to me if I always pee me at GitHub. I should be available most of the time in today's talk.
00:03:14 [W] I will spend the multiple time discussing about coding as project especially about the coredns.
00:03:16 [W] being as deployment in multi-cloud and hybrid Cloud environment
00:03:20 [W] before we get started.
00:03:33 [W] I want to introduce some of the background the up for Koreans project in case you are not familiar as some of you probably already know according as is cncf graduated level project.
00:03:41 [W] It's a flexible DNS server reading goal.
00:03:46 [W] goal. It has a focus on service Discovery. One of the great strengths of coding as is that according as is plug-in based.
00:03:52 [W] That means it can be easily extended for additional function as if you have any new feature.
00:04:01 [W] We're adding new functionality.
00:04:04 [W] can now see in the out of the box. You can always add by yourself if you know how to write Angola.
00:04:09 [W] when Ahmadi cloud and hybrid Cloud environment
00:04:14 [W] before we get started.
00:04:15 [W] I want to introduce some of the background of four coordinates project in case you are not familiar as some of you probably already know according as is cncf graduated level project.
00:04:16 [W] It's a flexible DNS server written in Gold. It has a focus on service Discovery. One of the great strengths of coding as is that according as is plug-in based.
00:04:18 [W] That means it can be easily extended for additional function as if you have any new feature or a new function in teh. You can now see in the out of the box. You can always add by yourself if you know how to write Angola.
00:04:22 [W] Another strength of recording is is a memory safety as we all know according as it's reading in Gola this actually put a great advantage of Gordon has compared against some other DNS servers such as bind we know
00:04:24 [W] no court has its rating Angola this actually put a great advantage of coding as compared against some other DNS servers such as bind we know by now operating in C language, although buying that has been used for many years
00:04:29 [W] C language, although buying that's been used for many years and that's been mature and the stable from time to time. We see security vulnerabilities popping up.
00:04:37 [W] And this is because of the the fundamental issue of C language it compare with bind.
00:04:48 [W] Cordelia is a fairly memory safe.
00:04:50 [W] In fact several years ago when pure 53 which is secreted out in company perform a security audit against the coding as they almost immediately switch the focus from memory and the buffer overflow
00:05:04 [W] the issues because they notice that weeks ago Le did not allow dogs your involvement a to scan for
00:05:12 [W] Cody insist self is started and the lead by make toobin when Nick started quoting as according us was actually named as the caddy has a real say that's because quoting ancestor time with
00:05:28 [W] K3s EP web server over the years according as and the cabinet has decoupled gradually, although there are some common infrastructure remains for example and most importantly the plug-in basic action
00:05:44 [W] Are still comes from caddy web server?
00:05:48 [W] Some people may ask a Christian.
00:05:59 [W] We already have a DNS servers and people have used DNS server for a long time.
00:06:01 [W] What's so special about coding Has the strength of cording us is it's a cloud native by clown native that means according as a has many features and functionalities. That's very much
00:06:15 [W] knative ecosystem for example coding as has extended the as protocols such as a DH / TOs and DS over du grpc and you might notice grpc protocol is
00:06:31 [W] Your survival a in many clubs cncf for project things like kubernative sell for heavily utilized the grpc by utilizing grpc coating as essentially behave the same
00:06:47 [W] Clown ATIV ecosystem. Another big point of coordinates is that according as is a default DNS server in kubernative as some of you probably probably know according
00:07:03 [W] in kubernative in as some of you might already know coding as has been shaped as part of the
00:07:14 [W] sorry, okay, as some of you might already know according as has been shift as a part of a kubernative distribution sings several versions ago and if we use qualities you are going to use coding as
00:07:30 [W] discovery
00:07:32 [W] including us that including as an kubernative the default mode for deployment is the so-called in class remote in classic Mode.
00:07:47 [W] You'll have a coding as deployed as as kubernative service by itself. And the our other services will depend on kubernative will depending on quality as service for service discovery.
00:07:58 [W] But some people may not know that coding is can actually be deployed out of the cluster as well.
00:08:14 [W] That means you can actually set up coding as outside of your kubernative worker node, and the still allows your kubernative cluster to communicate to coding as and the serving service Discovery functioning
00:08:20 [W] Going to discuss about the Autumn clouds that deployment for coating has allowed in this talk because let's say the essential component to make a multi cluster and multi-cloud acquirement possible.
00:08:33 [W] Another interesting point of according as is the cloud integration coding as has many Claudia Integrations from for several vendors.
00:08:48 [W] We have a wh Route 53 support.
00:08:49 [W] We have a Google Cloud DS and Agility has support as well.
00:09:02 [W] The reason we have a fairly good Cloud integration is that we this allows coating has to behave as a friend for many.
00:09:05 [W] Back and back under the DNS record imagine you'll have according a server and you can sync our for backend of different Cloud wonders such as the AWS throughout history and the Google cloudiness that will be very
00:09:18 [W] All because you'll have one central location to divert your service Discovery tasks.
00:09:26 [W] Let's get a closer. Look at the core file called file is according as way of configurations.
00:09:42 [W] It is essentially the file in a very simple format under Claudius desire has been in a way such ad we try to reduce you love as much as possible and because of that
00:09:54 [W] Format under Claudius / has been in a way such ad we try to reduce you love as much as possible and because of that inside the core file, you can achieve a lot of
00:09:56 [W] You can achieve a lot of functionalities which is several lines. As you can see in this simple code file. You only have around the ten lines of configuration yet.
00:10:09 [W] It evokes so many plugins the first cloudy in years.
00:10:13 [W] Let's recognize this plug-in, which I'm pretty I'm sure most of you guys probably already use that if you have a yield kinetics the second plug-in that's the route of History which allows you to sync up.
00:10:26 [W] Your Rod 53d as a record, I'm AWS the third plug-in we use here is the house plug-in house plug-in allows you to add additional inlined record. We are going to discuss that fairly shortly
00:10:39 [W] Which allows you to sync up your Rod facility as a record of AWS the third plug-in we use here is the house plug-in house plug-in allows you to add additional inlined record.
00:10:42 [W] We are going to discuss that fairly shortly. You also have health plug in the house check and permissive plugin for monitoring.
00:10:48 [W] And the finally you have the folder plug-in which essentially tells quoting as to forward unnie unnie DS that has now been handled to another DNS server such as Cloud flare or maybe just use Google
00:11:03 [W] And the fine line you have the folder plug-in which essentially tells quoting us to forward unnie unnie DS that has now been handled to another DNS server such as Cloud flare or maybe it is use
00:11:05 [W] It has to handle any additional thing as DNS queries.
00:11:10 [W] Let's give another example about plugins at the let's shrink down the plug-in into let's shrink down the core file into only two plugins why the host plug in another is a for the plug-in
00:11:30 [W] file shows you how to make this happen the forward the plug-in is possibly the value of 8.8.8.8 This Means Elder all the DNS query by default will be forwarded
00:11:45 [W] public DNS
00:11:47 [W] and under that we have the house of plug-in which here we only had one line. That is we add in line dance record of www.example.com log to point to one. Ninety two dot
00:12:04 [W] About a hundred and that's it.
00:12:08 [W] That's all you need to do to make some interesting application interesting thing as a vacation when you run cording us, which is a core file. You can check the track the deer check the DNS query
00:12:22 [W] And you can see from the bottom of the screen if you type like type Deke www.example.com log will return will be the record that you'll pass through your
00:12:38 [W] So this one example might be might be too simple, but it gives you a lot of possibilities.
00:12:48 [W] Just imagine you are it admin and you'll have a fairly big organization with let's say you have a fifty a d-- has a record you need to add but you're not very familiar with the as a protocol that you
00:13:00 [W] Even sure how to handle the different format in deity has its own file.
00:13:16 [W] So what you could do is you just add a fullback plan of pointing your your DNS server to forward the queries to Google public DNS and the for any internal DNS record like you're you know,
00:13:21 [W] Weighs several address like summed up some Internal Documentation side. You can just add a record in line. You will Co file with one call file and the coating is this give you the ability
00:13:38 [W] Being as manager Tina system in a fairly decent organization.
00:13:46 [W] Of course, we are talking about a small small number of being a director but interestingly Some people prefer to do it this way because that allows them to bypass all kind of, you know
00:13:59 [W] Recently Some people prefer to do it this way because that allows them to bypass all kinds of complicated configurations.
00:14:01 [W] They don't need to learn different grammar of complexity in a couple of years ago. I believe or maybe like one year ago.
00:14:13 [W] They are there is a use case from one user in GitHub.
00:14:19 [W] He actually asked a question and the question was
00:14:20 [W] that he used house plug-in to house the like tens of thousands of for Diaz record and he is still able to do that by this tens of thousands of DNS record in house
00:14:35 [W] Log in you'll probably get a sense of how big the DSL how how scalable coding as could be and how useful and the either.
00:14:48 [W] How useful are they? How easy according as is?
00:14:52 [W] We talked about for the plug-in, of course, that's a default mode and you can directly use that to forward your traffic to Google Pablo Diaz were maybe cloudflare that sometimes you want to add additional security.
00:15:08 [W] Father mold and you can directly use that to forward your traffic to Google publicity has were maybe cloudflare.
00:15:10 [W] Sometimes you want to add additional security the reading you want to add additional security is a DS by itself by default use UDP protocol and the UDP as we all know are not very secure.
00:15:20 [W] secure. So what infant someone hijacked fix some packet and fix some DS Ripley
00:15:27 [W] lies and poison your DNS server.
00:15:40 [W] You want to establish some secret connection to make sure the traffic coming from your cording a server and connect to the Google public DNS in the in the most secure way.
00:15:44 [W] Of course, you can achieve that with DNS server TOS, which is a function entirely supported by coding as auto box.
00:15:53 [W] Ways with Tina we still had some material as I will need to do is add the prefix rtls and that's it from the the core file on the above.
00:16:08 [W] You can see you add the TOs Colin slash four slash and all the traffic will be connected all the traffic on the Dia's Curry will be forwarded to Google public DNS in a secure way and you have
00:16:21 [W] Of course, this is just one see Mero.
00:16:31 [W] Sometimes you may want to use your Cordia to serve traffic self Curry that only coming from DNS server TOs and there are some reason for that while internally you can
00:16:42 [W] For kids it's secure and safe externally.
00:16:51 [W] Let's say you have a laptop outside out for your Enterprise with outside of Enterprise Network when you actually could allow your your laptop to connect
00:17:01 [W] And that's up asking Claudia to serve as a DNS server, even though you're let's say you are working from from home and this is a very good scenario to work with in order to make coordinate to
00:17:17 [W] see Mero to work ways in order to make coordinate to serve tea and as a material as queries I will need to do is prefix TOS at the beginning of your core file and you
00:17:27 [W] file and you achieve your goal already by the way Apple just recently announced that they are going to support a DS / TOS auto box for the for the next release of Mac OS
00:17:40 [W] This could be interesting because we start with Claudia's I think of we might see some additional usage of quoting us for selling the as of what he lacks in the future combine the with a trend out for moving Dina's into a more
00:17:56 [W] ways TOs
00:17:58 [W] Next next we are going to talk about a subject Discovery a lot of people say, okay, what exactly is service Discovery?
00:18:15 [W] So we Discovery is a way such act when you have a multiple Services you want each survey to be able to locate each other in a homogeneous way.
00:18:26 [W] The reason we talk about homogeneous.
00:18:27 [W] way. Is that your service even though we talk about the kubernative is all the time a lot.
00:18:32 [W] Time you still have Services is located or scattered around different locations different systems.
00:18:40 [W] You might have a service.
00:18:42 [W] That's actually on AWS and you may using AWS provided mandatory service like America because it doesn't make sense for you to manage some stateful Services yourself if your company is not big enough
00:18:56 [W] So have some sell these that's actually located on Google cloud, or maybe I'll Microsoft will draw in that case. The service themself are coming service record of themselves are coming from different data sources,
00:19:11 [W] To do the consolidation. This is a Challenger for service te karere, but that's also the place that we are coordinates s been doing pretty real.
00:19:21 [W] Cody has the big Advantage for Claudia's is according as he's able to consolidate data from different sources.
00:19:33 [W] It can come in from it can sync up data to aw router III it can sync up data for Microsoft or Draw It can sink of data for Google Cloud.
00:19:46 [W] But some people may ask a question say in this day and age we are sdn is so easy.
00:19:55 [W] And that's the a is the easily available in many places.
00:20:00 [W] Do we really have a need for DS? In fact, I was asked this question many times why why discuss with some of the folks in this area?
00:20:10 [W] And to me? I think Athena is still serve as the best way for servicemeshcon.
00:20:15 [W] discovering for several reasons
00:20:17 [W] So first of all, Tina as is a nice introduction, even though we ci/cd and you might be able to assign server service in ways of fixed IP address.
00:20:31 [W] You never know.
00:20:32 [W] Next year, you may decide for some reason you want to move everything to your private data center, or you want to move everything to Google Cloud.
00:20:52 [W] It may not be so easy if if our infrastructure is IP based but we still as is super easy to to G security has record to show that the same DNS name.
00:21:05 [W] It's simple easy to touches the Trinity as record to show that the same DNS name will be mapped to a deer map to a different IP address this actually give you much
00:21:12 [W] IP address this actually give you much flexibility you need to to counter anything surprising in the future.
00:21:19 [W] Another reason for Cordelia has to be used in service Discovery is that a DNS is easy and simple and we have shown in the in the past slide coding itself is a system that has been designed in
00:21:36 [W] Waste of philosophy of Simplicity mine. You can easily add a record you can think of different sources and it can be easily deployed in many format.
00:21:50 [W] Another thing we want to discuss about DS at the youthfulness is because D is by nature is distributed.
00:22:03 [W] It may not be the most sophisticated distribute system. Although it's still pretty real and it's it's massively scalable.
00:22:10 [W] We all know Dina is skills to internet because that's how internet works and that give you a sense of why Diaz could be a good could be a good solution either way to solve a distributed system.
00:22:25 [W] And the finally another reason for dinner. So we use in service Discovery is a DS by itself is very pervasive in it infrastructure.
00:22:37 [W] DNS has been there in many years and over the years a lot of things change. Our DNA has pretty much remain the same. So in any it infrastructure you could see being as our place
00:22:50 [W] Can be easily integrated into intro existing it infrastructure no matter how Legacy that could be.
00:22:59 [W] So let's recapture the profile we showed you just a moment ago to to revisit y-coordinates could be a good choice.
00:23:14 [W] In this profile, we invoked many plugins, but I want to point out one more thing those flagging actually consists of at least four different data sources.
00:23:30 [W] The first is a kubernative plugin. That means you can you can think of a data safety net sexual D exposure in kubernative API server for your for your services deployed in kubernative
00:23:41 [W] Effective string is plug-in allows you to easily connect your service in connect the servicemeshcon / AWS AWS club and the house flagging could be something
00:23:57 [W] Malaysian we are you have some random servers or big bug servers sitting there Standalone serving some special need.
00:24:06 [W] And the finally you have for your hair before the plug-in which means all the other DNS queries will be processed by another DNS server.
00:24:18 [W] We used cloth flares one dot one dot one dot one adds example, but this one can be can be replaced by anything a server of your choice.
00:24:28 [W] We discuss about the coding has and we want to get him through the increasing part of a multi-class deployment for coding as I'm sure many of you already know how to deploy prodyna is in a
00:24:47 [W] I'm sure many of you already know how to deploy Cordia as in a standalone kubernative cluster, but what if you have multiple clusters, what do you feel have what if you have a clusters that's located in different
00:24:57 [W] Like some class and might be in your private data center. Some cluster might be it already has some cluster might be on Google Cloud how you're going to make sure your service it in one cluster can be
00:25:13 [W] Under service another cluster and behave just like one unified cluster.
00:25:20 [W] In order to achieve that they are some requirement to make this happen as a networking level.
00:25:37 [W] So first of all, I will cluster that has need to have a non-overlapping cluster side of loc.
00:25:45 [W] This is understandable because you for that IP address space has has we uniquely in order to allow one class to talk to another cluster and secondly and IP allocated within any cluster should be right.
00:25:53 [W] From another cluster case may not be so straightforward because many many communities deployment assume the the internal IP is are not visible, but you can still make this happen.
00:26:09 [W] Like in know in you can certainly add additional Rod to your to your router table to allow traffic to to be accessible from one cluster to another some time by changing role tables
00:26:24 [W] Or sometimes add additional Rod or switches as needed.
00:26:30 [W] And the finally multi-class a deployment.
00:26:43 [W] It only works for Hadley service. The reason is that when we use a standard Class C IP Services, the class IV is handled by Curry for oxy and we also could be process cannot
00:26:50 [W] Your class does if we are truly make model class that we managed by one could be products by one could be proxy system then essentially that became one cluster. So it loses all the benefit you try to.
00:27:06 [W] All the all the benefit your try to bring in.
00:27:19 [W] in. So we are only going to discuss about the heavily service. But the even with sadly service is still give you point out for enhancement. We will discuss the filler shortly.
00:27:23 [W] This is a standard ink last deployment and that's the standard deployment model.
00:27:38 [W] you're going to use when you have kubernative cluster in place in in class of deployment coding has will be deployed by self will be deployed at the service just like any other service the only the only thing
00:27:51 [W] That a lot of the service will depend on coding us to resolve the dress of service.
00:28:00 [W] So there are some dependencies but Koreans itself is deployed inside your kubernative workin out. But what we want to talk about here is the art of cluster deployment
00:28:14 [W] So deployment by definition is to move the quality as outside of kubernative working on not a lot of people notice that but it is available including us
00:28:29 [W] I am essentially all you need to do is to move according as outside of kubernative worker node, and the make sure quoting as Courage the API server in the court file itself
00:28:45 [W] Ideas can reach the API server in the court file itself. As you can see you should add an entry called endpoint and the specify the address of a pi server, and that should be all you need
00:28:55 [W] Wind and the specify the address of a pi server and that should be all you need to to allow Cody and to think of it has server and the gather all the service record.
00:29:04 [W] You also need to specify cluster DNS cluster DS of your kubernative cluster to point recording as IP address so that they could locate the they could send a DNS query to codeine has
00:29:16 [W] U.s.
00:29:17 [W] And that's it.
00:29:20 [W] That's all the out of class and apply why out of class deploys important because this is exactly this is exactly what you need in order to make a multi cluster deployment.
00:29:32 [W] In multi-class deployment you may have module clusters and you want to have your you want your clothing as to grab the service record from both say Pi servers to classes how to achieve
00:29:49 [W] The default kubernative cluster may now be able to reach your goal. But there is external plug-in called kubernative plugin.
00:29:59 [W] You can use lies this flag into to to make the multi-class a deployment available kubernative plugin, behave exactly the same as kubernative plugin.
00:30:14 [W] only difference is the kubernative plugin for kubernative plugin. You can specify as many kubernative cluster as possible and you'll use and applying to point to the API servers of each cluster.
00:30:28 [W] in this example, as you can see you actually have two clusters one cluster has a pi server once in 2038 attend attend another class that has a pi server
00:30:44 [W] data, $20 10 you'll specify kubernative plugin twice the first cluster you assign a domain name of class A1 dot local the second cluster you assign domain name our cluster 2 dot local
00:31:00 [W] We start simple profile. You are cheeks ago.
00:31:04 [W] for allowing your service to talk to each to talk to each other.
00:31:09 [W] But the only glitch is that your service is still separated.
00:31:14 [W] each each class has a unique base base DS domain such as you're pretty much just like just just like randomly throughout some adding something as the record and it's may
00:31:30 [W] Is that interesting for many people but there are some additional ways. So make this thing interesting.
00:31:38 [W] With kubernative plugin, you can add a full through full circle line in configuration.
00:31:51 [W] We say social you can have the same base domain name of class our local for both clusters.
00:31:58 [W] see this configuration as you can see if a service if a service is reachable in the ritual within the same cluster, it will be reached.
00:32:08 [W] If it's not reachable the according as we actually false fall back to the second cluster and the fat Sheila service for you.
00:32:22 [W] So that means if you deploy to Services of the same name into clusters and the and that could serve as a fault tolerance because you'll have to your actually can if you are
00:32:32 [W] Come to reach your first he's going to reach a service and first cluster and if it's not available, it will automatically applying to the service in the second cluster.
00:32:45 [W] They say is the increasing case.
00:32:47 [W] That's could be very useful for many people.
00:32:51 [W] I'm going to fast forward this one, but if you are interested, you can take a look at our kubernative plugin and see how this can help you in Fault tolerance for module clusters.
00:33:01 [W] Okay, we are livid running out of time.
00:33:13 [W] So I want to speed up a little bit and discuss for the hybrid cloud and multi clock.
00:33:19 [W] So what is a hybrid Cloud hybrid Cloud essentially give you essentially means you deploy kubernative both on Purim and and on the clock.
00:33:27 [W] This is an interesting situation. We are we are there are some insects the situation you do one.
00:33:32 [W] To you don't want some some of them sell it to be deployed differently.
00:33:38 [W] But by self hybrid cloud is no different than multi-cloud.
00:33:48 [W] We are you'll have communities the applied all over the place in Google cloud in AWS in your private is centers.
00:33:57 [W] This might be for different reasons.
00:34:03 [W] For example, you might want to always use the service always at your service provided by different Cloud windows, or you want to find you want to
00:34:13 [W] To you want to combine the best service out of all in many scenarios?
00:34:21 [W] We do want to to Showcase couples to shoke to explain how could he has handled Cloud integration?
00:34:36 [W] Because that caused a lot of confusion in coding as the people ask how the coating as talk to Italy roughly three.
00:34:47 [W] It's actually not true the UDP traffic as many a many people believed.
00:34:52 [W] It's actually through the AWS is roughly 3.
00:34:54 [W] A pi API and the plane in this way. The traffic is dancer.
00:35:01 [W] Hvs which is much more secure which also means you you can carry the same authentication and authorization.
00:35:14 [W] So I am policy and I'm the I am and policies and the rules because it's a TPS.
00:35:22 [W] It's also much more reliable because TCP is much better in
00:35:23 [W] It's much better in error handling and also it's a TCP connection oriented. Finally weighs 80 PS.
00:35:38 [W] You can separate the data sync app and the DNS query into separate into different channels. So they don't they don't compete each other.
00:35:43 [W] As a final the final step. I want to showcase daemul, but because it is a virtual.
00:35:55 [W] It's a bunch of conference.
00:36:03 [W] I think it's going to be hard to show a demo, but I want to show a profile that you can play by yourself to see how to combine data from different sources and pretend to have only one friend
00:36:10 [W] for quote ads Cardenas
00:36:13 [W] This is the core file. We want to show you actually add a three at three plugins.
00:36:24 [W] The first is the roughest ring, which you can create a which actually you can create a DNS Zone AWS and copy the ID here this way.
00:36:36 [W] The domain name according as start example.org will be handled by draw phase 3 the second plug-in is cloudiness, which you are going to do a similar thing except the zone is created
00:36:52 [W] Google Cloud
00:36:53 [W] the which means Claudia's which means are for any any domain name that has now been handled by roughly 3 will be 1st row and handled by cloudiness.
00:37:07 [W] The fourth row is thanks to the optional first line in both in draw faces configuration.
00:37:19 [W] Of course, you can also add a fourth rule configuration cloudiness as well in this case quoting as will find the next plug-in to figure out how to do if they still cannot find a match in
00:37:32 [W] India's record, you can certainly add a who am I and all you can just forwarded to some other place this will give you a case of you can
00:37:47 [W] Great, you can have a three machines different places and when you send a query to coding as if your machine is located on AWS the that the return the IP will be
00:38:02 [W] AWS and if this if this domain is not available, I WS you will get a reply from from Google Cloud if it's available or it might be some other places like a who am I
00:38:17 [W] Like the one cent $2,000 0.1 by who am I plug in or you may just simply add single add a line to forward all the remaining remaining DNS queries to some other place
00:38:32 [W] prodyna server and this is a very interesting play that helps you to know to to design some interesting systems that make it really useful for your scenario
00:38:47 [W] And I'll could be done with coding as which actually is very simple and easy to config Pro configure Pi system that fits nicely in Cologne ATIV ecosystem.
00:39:06 [W] I think that's pretty much it for today's talk.
00:39:17 [W] talk. If anyone then any questions, you can certainly ask I'll try to answer as much as possible.
00:39:20 [W] conferencing enter your conference code
00:39:26 [W] code
00:39:33 [W] Hello is a current session started?
00:41:02 [W] Yes, young. If you go ahead and start reading the questions that you're going to answer now and go and then answer the question.
00:41:32 [W] Okay. Sure. So I look through the questions to raise the in the the first question is according as to consolidate the two different external DNS
00:41:45 [W] Providing the doubter for the same domain the question the answer is yes.
00:41:52 [W] It's definitely possible.
00:41:55 [W] You can look into some of the configurations of present a the configuration samples presented in this English toffee probably know there's a lot of the plugins allow you to specify the option of so-called of also
00:42:08 [W] Suppose so essentially is if you have one plug-in that's actually trying to do something and this plug-in cannot find jobs find the record from one back end.
00:42:22 [W] Of course.
00:42:23 [W] it's going to move to the next next plug-in allowed next plug-in to continue searching so that should be possible I think.
00:42:31 [W] okay, let me see the second question which configure option which configure option for so many men that exist, especially the
00:42:43 [W] That's the Kobe has coordinates of serverless self is more like a front end and the serving the data record on the back end the measurement of the data
00:42:59 [W] Good. I'm also handling the back end by different different plug-ins. For example, if your if your data is stored in a tone file, according as will merely just presenting The Zone file as a DS server.
00:43:13 [W] I bet if we want to change make any modifications you have to modify the Zone file and the great start recording a server if or even behind your back end is from
00:43:29 [W] Dynamically manage the sword for example, if we are back in the AWS has AWS your office's story in that situation called the as should be able to just constantly Factory Direct backhand and forehand cup date. It will update
00:43:43 [W] Fun time that to presently of that the answers record presenting of updated DS2 record.
00:43:50 [W] Okay, the third question they are confined this Slide the slide should be available around on the schedule on the schedule of the kubeacademy link if you'll still have trouble finding a slight
00:44:07 [W] You can send me an email. My email is available.
00:44:19 [W] You can find my email in from underneath my GitHub handle like it up handle is if you are young count my first name and the last name, you should be easily find my email and assembly, you know, I will for the YouTube link that
00:44:24 [W] So that you can find the slide.
00:44:26 [W] Okay, the the next one could be as can transfer to only serverless TS server.
00:44:41 [W] This is as far as I know. We are actually going to develop develop results.
00:44:47 [W] only twice for feature of quantum mechanics. I think are some programs epsagon has been made by some maintenance and a contributor. I cannot remember if it's the complete with your mouth at the moment, but I
00:44:58 [W] I can double-check and yeah, that's heavy. I also have a question. You can drop me an e-mail or read the question in the encoding as a GitHub repo and we should be able to answer that in
00:45:13 [W] in more details
00:45:15 [W] another question
00:45:19 [W] I understand that you're deployed according as outside the kubernative as its kind of service in this case.
00:45:29 [W] How do you deploy that as I mentioned in the presentation Courtney is when Cordina to try to reach out to a kubernative club de and the get all the information all cording as me
00:45:42 [W] he's a pi server address if they are quality has it's located on the same same server as kubernative database server for the a tree or connect directly at 7:10 all the information needed
00:45:57 [W] The cordilleras, of course, he'll expose Port 53 as a UV Court. You can just set up a your class studying at the point where the IP of the cordilla as IP and
00:46:12 [W] I'm should complete the your deployment in case you want to have multiple coding as multiple DNS server serving your needs you can certainly just locate the different machines outside our cluster and along as quality has can uh,
00:46:27 [W] And reach to the API server, you you're rich like that server. The coordinates IP can be feeding into the cluster configuration as the DS at the DS survive.
00:46:42 [W] So like I said a cop even though the in crops that require Mode called the as can be considered as part of the class standards as part of the service, but you feel really challenged outside of this concept.
00:46:56 [W] just consider coding as as a
00:46:57 [W] Another static server, you should notice that according as kind of factory only need a better survival kubernative and you can reach 40s and your service will be ready to be served.
00:47:12 [W] Okay, another question, that's interesting that are you using private Zone being a hybrid Cloud example, we say that we attend the Google yet to be a using private soames.
00:47:31 [W] Actually, you can use both private zones and the height private zones and public results in any way you want if in fact there is one interesting
00:47:42 [W] Okay, so is that you may we all know in Google cloud in Google Cloud you normally you are signing a song to a VC C. But Google Cloud actually allows you to
00:47:57 [W] now the assign had sewn to a VCC and uh own is now accessible from anyone but the record is still there and you can see the record in that case if you deploy
00:48:12 [W] Claudius and the quality has is able to access your Google Cloud API. Actually, you can just serve your service DNS record, which should be accessible inside the Google and
00:48:27 [W] You can just serve it to outside and maybe a private UTC or maybe a local machine.
00:48:36 [W] So this in this situation, this is the increasing Pace. We are we are Google Cloud. That penis is essentially just a database for your for your DS record and it's not doing anything else and that's
00:48:47 [W] Interesting use case so many people might be want to years if we want to manage songs.
00:48:52 [W] Okay.
00:49:02 [W] Okay. See there's no other question.
00:49:05 [W] Just wanting anyone else and I need questions I can answer.
00:49:06 [W] Okay, I think I I saw the question.
00:49:16 [W] Yes, before we finalize still has any questions. You can reach out to me or reach out to any coding as you containerless in coding as GitHub handle and you can also talk about email to me.
00:49:27 [W] You should be able to find by email underneath my chin up handle Again songs for genres this talk and appreciate the help and appreciate the questions raised in.
00:49:41 [W] Clark that's definitely going to improve allow us to continuously improve coding us.
00:49:48 [W] Thanks folks. Have a great day.
