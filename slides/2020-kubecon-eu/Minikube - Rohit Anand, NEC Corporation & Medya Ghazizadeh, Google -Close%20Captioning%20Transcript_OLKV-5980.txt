00:08:51 [W] Hello coupon.
00:13:49 [W] My name is Media Quezada.
00:13:49 [W] I'm a tech lead at the party part team at Google which is a nickname for the Google's containerd tools team.
00:13:51 [W] I also have it's me Rohit and and from NEC we'd be giving us a demo of how to contribute a new language to minikube.
00:13:58 [W] It's a Pity that I cannot do this talk in person and alive to see your faces in graphql.
00:14:01 [W] Actions, but also to blame my imperfections and the mistakes in this talk and being like, so let's get started with recording stock.
00:14:13 [W] So whenever I go to conferences and then talkbot minikube with tech in the tech events. The first thing they bring up is a minikube emojis on how many you expresses itself in.
00:14:29 [W] To blame my imperfections and the mistakes in this talk and being life. So let's get start it recording stop.
00:14:31 [W] So whenever I go to conferences and I talked lat minikube with tech in the tech events. The first thing we bring up is a minikube emojis and how minikube expresses itself in.
00:14:32 [W] My jeez, I would like to take one slide to acknowledge the hard work and the passion that I have witnessed from from this names myself people like Thomas Stromberg myself.
00:14:48 [W] I'm under spiritual and Chevelle Kemal pre-award.
00:14:52 [W] Oh Josie.
00:14:55 [W] Tony said she and previous maintainers of minikube like done Lauren MetroCard are in Prindle and in your contributors in minikube.
00:15:03 [W] Such as Cove Argo Urban bias and more than 500 minikube contributors.
00:15:11 [W] Thank you very much.
00:15:15 [W] Minikube Spire Mary goal before me start his let me clarify that it's local kubenetes like bring up a kubernative cluster on your local machine.
00:15:31 [W] It's not meant for a production remote cluster as a cncf project c classic lifecycle project five things that I would like to just quickly mention what minikube provides a very
00:15:43 [W] Before we start is let me clarify that it's local kubernative like bring up a kubernative cluster on your local machine.
00:15:44 [W] It's not meant for a production remote cluster as a cncf project c classic lifecycle project five things that I would like to just quickly mention what minikube provides a very
00:15:45 [W] it's images bit darker and and five other ways and also access your app Mount your files into the cluster feature Gates and more intimate violence, but what's new minikube, you
00:15:59 [W] Is joke to to like get the rhyme of this title, by the way once secret that I'm going to share with you with that. We minikube maintainers. We never never
00:16:13 [W] Tyfa, minikube it capital M. Yes something that you should never see minikube Z mini. Minikube.
00:16:23 [W] It's not minikube.
00:16:25 [W] So Capital know what's new minikube.
00:16:34 [W] minikube is 86 percent faster since last year. It uses 20% less CPU.
00:16:39 [W] It has two new drivers.
00:16:40 [W] We have multi node. We have a new command called pause and unpause by exciting
00:16:43 [W] And other select flags for you, and we have five tools that graduated order of minikube.
00:16:54 [W] I'm going to give you a deeper look up all of these things that I just announced before that.
00:16:59 [W] Let's take a mental picture of this slide and not forget it.
00:17:01 [W] Let's take a mental picture and minikube supports all of these users. Also those green ones are the ones that you have integration test for it and we cannot break it every PR and minikube. You have to support them. You have to support the guy with Linux.
00:17:13 [W] And amd64 KVM driver and any of those containerd on X and any of those cni-genie and any of those combinations is possible. We support it.
00:17:26 [W] All and we've net cni-genie.
00:17:59 [W] Here's an example somebody with Mac OS but have any 64 and they are using our VM drivers opposed to containerd driver, which is hyper credit and containerd E in Bridge.
00:18:13 [W] Meanwhile, they could have chosen Mac and a 64 Docker driver cryo are any of them? So the combinations are a lot is a slightest stole from the previous Q Khan we did and
00:18:24 [W] Using our VM driver as opposed to containerd driver which is hyprocrites and containerd E in Bridge.
00:18:25 [W] Meanwhile, they could have chosen Mac and a 64 darker driver cryo are any of them? So the combinations are a lot is a slightest soul from the previous Q Khan he did and
00:18:27 [W] Like where the driver is and then the containerd driver is and the very very top of the rocket is your app.
00:18:36 [W] I'm gonna skip quickly because it's going to be very compressed Toc and I apologize for speaking very fast because they're too much to cover.
00:18:41 [W] This is a graph that shows how much minikube is faster.
00:18:48 [W] minikube is 86 percent faster since last year. It used to take two minutes and 35 seconds. Just
00:18:55 [W] As for a start and now it seemed driver takes 35 seconds and if you have darker driver and Linux, it takes 21 seconds.
00:19:08 [W] How did we get here?
00:19:13 [W] These are not Away by the way to look at how faster minikube has become least one is compared to other tools. This is how
00:19:19 [W] Fast minikube is available for deployment of an app so compared to in these three k3s minikube and kind k3s the fastest.
00:19:30 [W] It means the blue shows you when Katie is telling you it's ready for for receiving apps the red shows you when the API server is actually ready to take requests and green shows you when you can actually
00:19:46 [W] Lester so in k3s, you can see roughly is around 25 or minikube is roughly around 45 and for kind is a prophet like 65 and kids really by the way.
00:20:00 [W] It does not use kubenetes source code completely the fork some part of it it replaced at CD. That's why they are faster.
00:20:07 [W] So minikube seems like in this script that was run hundred thirteen times with you can check the time to Kate's on GitHub and Thomas.
00:20:17 [W] A repo to reproduce this result.
00:20:22 [W] How did we get from 2 minutes and 35 seconds to 21 seconds step one was collecting metrics.
00:20:30 [W] We want to know where we can invest to make PR are so many ideas.
00:20:35 [W] We had how to make minikube faster.
00:20:39 [W] many and we said, how about you read write a PR but GitHub, but that will comment and says this PR makes minikube this much faster or slower.
00:20:47 [W] And pretty I did this and it helped us massively to avoid accepting PRS that was adding tons of complexity minikube and was not doing actually any significant meaningful
00:21:02 [W] Another tool is slow jam which Thomas wrote and which is a UI visualizing the printed stacked races.
00:21:18 [W] Let's show that exactly which function exactly. The function was. The one that we should attack to break it down for to make it faster or make it run in parallel.
00:21:28 [W] big targets was creating the VM and also loading images into the Container runtime is 32
00:21:34 [W] Big ones the first one when I first joined minikube a team.
00:21:41 [W] This was my second serious task that I picked up and I saw yours. This was a long issue.
00:21:48 [W] This is an issue from 2016 that people asked us to please add darker support, dr. Driver.
00:21:56 [W] and
00:21:59 [W] we had not done this feature and I want to join as a why nobody did this why nobody added a darker driver for minikube what would happen if we just create a container just the same way as we create a VM and then we strap the queries inside of it and
00:22:15 [W] Support, dr. Driver
00:22:16 [W] and
00:22:16 [W] we had not done this feature and I want to join as a why nobody did this why nobody added a darker driver for minikube what would happen if we just create a container just the same way as we create a VM and then we strap the queries inside of it and
00:22:18 [W] You what we do for museums why we are not doing that and answer was when you do that it crashes and I there was a project called kind and it looked at it.
00:22:30 [W] It's like what kind is doing that we are not doing why did they are not crashing and we are crashing when we do that and the answer was in this red hat blog.
00:22:38 [W] It's like the real problem was systemd cannot run in a container if you don't do some tricks.
00:22:46 [W] So our problem become much much smaller now now our problem was like how to make systemd work inside container and inside a container. And once we solve this problem by basically using the same entry point as
00:23:00 [W] So our problem become much much smaller. Now know our problem was like how to make systemd work inside container and inside a container. And once we solve this problem by basically using the same entry point as
00:23:01 [W] And entry pointed fixes this problem for the image.
00:23:09 [W] We basically add darker driver bye-bye. Basically creating the containerd the same way. We create the VM and do the same thing we do for the VM and but there was still other
00:23:24 [W] He had to take care of like refactoring a lot of the minikube code to be more abstract and more you reusable. And the answer was like he could we have all the features of minikube. The question was like yes.
00:23:41 [W] some of the features took longer
00:23:44 [W] and when we added the darker driver we are we have so many drivers and we don't want to make talker a special case in.
00:23:57 [W] Say why not add Padma and driver and we a Department Driver and we were the first project to experiment with.
00:24:08 [W] delivering experimental part man
00:24:11 [W] driver
00:24:16 [W] so the challenges were actually two features of minikube on Mac and windows only not on Linux because in Darker for desktop on Mac and windows, you don't get an IP which is accessible and
00:24:34 [W] And when you don't want to make talker a special case in say why not add Padma and driver and we a Department Driver and we were the first project to experiment with.
00:24:36 [W] we have a contributor of is a networking ninja Jose it and he said she he
00:24:41 [W] he found a solution how to make minikube sternal and service work for darker and mac and windows that's involves using SSH tunneling. Sorry SSH port forwarding.
00:24:55 [W] So kick minikube one minute Faster by the way.
00:25:06 [W] Kick is the short name for kubernative Xin container in minikube code base. If you want to contribute to the docker driver or part one driver you want to look at the kick driver which is kubernative and container.
00:25:19 [W] Named for kubernative Xin container in minikube code base. If you want to contribute to the darker driver or part one driver you want to look at the kick driver which is kubernative and container.
00:25:21 [W] Let me call it internally in minikube Gold base.
00:25:27 [W] So kick me out and minikube one minute faster. But still it was a long way to become very under 35 seconds. The next Target was pre loading the images.
00:25:39 [W] So can we preload images for vm's as well?
00:25:46 [W] For example, the project like kind they would build an image that has all the things they want to take pre-loaded / kubernative version. So if you want different queries version you want
00:25:50 [W] A different world a different image and that has all the things in there.
00:25:57 [W] That would not be applicable for minikube for post VM and darker dreary.
00:26:01 [W] We just follow different workflow.
00:26:06 [W] How could we have preloads for minikube?
00:26:10 [W] That doesn't make darker driver a special case because we want to still remember that mental picture from the slides all Linux Mac Windows always drivers. We want to keep
00:26:20 [W] All of those cases and not make a dock or ever a snowflake or special case.
00:26:26 [W] So how do we do that?
00:26:29 [W] We came up with a solution that we have the base image or the iso ISO for the VM base image for the container and they are.
00:26:37 [W] They don't have the kubenetes image inside of them.
00:26:49 [W] It file system and we just untie right into the VM that makes a little bit of a problem that that takes time to untie or something and also download something the download takes only the runtime.
00:27:06 [W] There's next time you will not download it again, but the untiring could could be adding overhead.
00:27:17 [W] So we came up with a solution that we spin up excite container in parallel. We do the untiring there make a volume out of it and then attach it to The Container while the
00:27:24 [W] other continuous spinning up.
00:27:31 [W] So we save time by paralyzation here and that's how we actually got to the most of the 86 percent goal.
00:27:33 [W] Minikube.
00:27:38 [W] There's actually tons of other small optimization each one with cut two three four five seconds from minikube, but these two were the top biggest one and Priya implemented the preload as well.
00:27:48 [W] By the way speaking of Priya. We have a Toc Toc iot.
00:27:52 [W] Cause you to take a look at the recorded version of it improving the performance of kubeedge cluster is I screenshots from her talk.
00:28:04 [W] This is how minikube see if you were hired as over time, which is incredibly amazing to see minikube be the tool that uses the least amount of CPU even less than K 3 D
00:28:14 [W] This shows minikube k3s D Dr. Desktop and kind and see kind of has the highest GPA over his age and dunker Idol means nothing really it means means like only darker and nothing on it.
00:28:30 [W] That's how much an empty and nothing on it's darker with its use from the CPU 0.47 and a minikube on hyper kids take uses 3.89.
00:28:44 [W] And kind uses 5.5.
00:28:47 [W] By the way, the script to generate these are all available.
00:28:52 [W] The links will be the end of the slide.
00:28:56 [W] This is also another visualization of the same data showing minikube having the lowest amount of CPU after all of the optimization that Priya. Did you have to watch that talk to see what she did for that another.
00:29:08 [W] The links will be the end of the slide is also another visualization of the same data showing minikube having the lowest amount of CPU after of the optimization that Priya. Did you have to watch that talk to see what she did for
00:29:09 [W] Future.
00:29:11 [W] Sorry about that is minikube pause.
00:29:18 [W] So we did a lot of analyzation using slow jam using perf tools that we developed and
00:29:24 [W] if I'm not the kubernative is a pi server is actually the one which is the source of the problem. Like if the kublr and is a pi server was not there minikube was like almost nothing in terms of CPU overhead
00:29:40 [W] At that is see what if we pause the API server.
00:29:45 [W] And we did that and then the cool thing about it your abs are still running when a pi server is pause and you only need a pi server when you want to deploy more apps.
00:29:59 [W] there are so you can unpause it deploy more apps and then pause it so you came up with a New Concept in kubernative a local company is called pots and you can see in this graph that apposite minikube.
00:30:13 [W] Is almost as like an idol Docker in terms of CPU usage.
00:30:20 [W] Another exciting thing was shave algo Mal. He implemented the most reacted feature in the history of minikube.
00:30:33 [W] Also a 2016 issue.
00:30:46 [W] This was actually a sooner issue than the M3 issue is issue number 294. It's incredible looking at this because now we have tens of thousands of issues.
00:30:49 [W] I mean the in number so we have multi nodes. Thanks to sheriff.
00:30:52 [W] come over very implementing this
00:30:55 [W] Another exciting thing here is we have Auto Select options minikube has so much options. If you do minikube start - - help you see is so much.
00:31:09 [W] I'm used to make people passed it VM driver do them today start now you no longer have to pass anything.
00:31:19 [W] We check your system find the best driver based on your system.
00:31:19 [W] What is healthy?
00:31:25 [W] What is the best how score for each driver and we pick the best driver for you and also based on your system. We pick the best cni-genie.
00:31:26 [W] I the best memory everything is already selected for you in a Smart Way based on your needs. Not a generic default value is another exciting product.
00:31:38 [W] That helps you develop apps on minikube easier when you want to when you want your apps wants to do credential it calls to
00:31:59 [W] So you no longer have to mount your secret to every pot if you enable this add-on it will do it for you automatically.
00:32:06 [W] Check it out.
00:32:07 [W] So demo time, I would like to hit to tell us how to add a new language to minikube. Let's take a listen.
00:32:16 [W] Hello everybody.
00:32:22 [W] My name is Rohit and I'm senior member technical staff at NEC.
00:32:25 [W] So my talk is mainly focused for the new contributors who wanna get started with the communities and I bet minikube is the first rep.
00:32:32 [W] Oh, he would love to contribute to let's get started.
00:32:35 [W] So before we start of any code or review contribution, we have to go to multiple accounts set up and sign the CLA.
00:32:42 [W] firstly we need to create the GitHub account using company email address or you can also link your existing database account using your company email address or individual email addresses, but make sure it is primary and visible to all
00:32:56 [W] Now you need to create Linux Foundation identity for that. You need to login using your GitHub account. Once you login into your GitHub account, your GitHub username will be automatically pre-populated.
00:33:13 [W] You need to fill out your first name last name and submit the form will create your identity on the Linux foundation and identity Porter.
00:33:20 [W] Now you need to create Linux Foundation identity for that. You need to login using your GitHub account. Once you logged in into your GitHub account, your GitHub username will be automatically pre-populated.
00:33:30 [W] You need to fill out your first name last name and submit the form.
00:33:31 [W] It will create your identity on the Linux foundation and identity Porter. If you are signing the CLA using your organization pain, then mentions of the
00:33:32 [W] You can name email addresses and all the individual contributors name and email addresses are required to sign the ceiling. Once this form is submitted.
00:33:40 [W] a silly will be sent to the individual email and it must be signed electronically.
00:33:41 [W] Now you play to authorize the cncf contribution. So please authorize this link using sign up to continue this project as an employee.
00:33:56 [W] So once you click on that link your Linux Foundation profile should look something like this.
00:33:57 [W] If you want to know more detail about cncf CLA, please check out this links.
00:34:03 [W] Now I'm going to demo how to create a pull request in minikube, but before creating a pull request you need something to work on.
00:34:14 [W] For that you need to visit the minikube repo on the guitar.
00:34:19 [W] So as you can see there are bunch of issues here.
00:34:30 [W] So for the first time contributors contributors, so I recommend try picking up issues good first.
00:34:39 [W] So there are several good first issue over here.
00:34:45 [W] You can pick any one of them.
00:34:47 [W] Creating a pull request you need something to work on.
00:34:59 [W] For that you need to visit the minikube repo on the guitar.
00:35:00 [W] So as you can see there are bunch of issues here.
00:35:00 [W] So for the first time contributors contributors, so I recommend try picking up issues good first.
00:35:01 [W] So there are several good first issue over here.
00:35:01 [W] You can pick any one of them.
00:35:02 [W] After that, you need to fog this repository to your local repo.
00:35:03 [W] Once it is spoke to your local repo. You need to clone it on your local machine.
00:35:03 [W] So I already know need my local machine. So my good first issue is
00:35:07 [W] how to add new language in the minikube
00:35:13 [W] so all the new translations are being stored in the top level translation directory.
00:35:25 [W] So if you want to add new language to the minikube, you need to add new Json file in the translation directory with the local code of language. You want to add translation for so I am using here jfrog Japanese.
00:35:34 [W] Now you need to run meat extract command from the root to populate that file with the string.
00:35:43 [W] To be translated in Json format. Once it is done you need to add translate it is spring into the Json file as the value of the map where English phrase is the key
00:36:02 [W] With this ring to be translated in Jason phone.
00:36:03 [W] Once it is done, you need to add translate any string into the Json file as the value of the map where English phrase is the key.
00:36:04 [W] Once you have added all your translations, you need to rebuild the minikube from scratch.
00:36:10 [W] And for rebuilding used make Command.
00:36:16 [W] Once make Command is completed.
00:36:22 [W] It will create a fresh minikube binary in the a directory. So if you have CMC some local.
00:36:27 [W] Then minikube start from the all directly gonna work as a test. If you have different system local you can override the printed version using LC all environment variable.
00:36:42 [W] So I am using here Japanese.
00:36:43 [W] minikube start
00:36:52 [W] I'm starting minikube with dr.
00:36:56 [W] Docker driver.
00:36:57 [W] So as you can see, you are a translation for Japanese and minikube starting in Japanese.
00:37:09 [W] So it's verifying that kubenetes component now.
00:37:10 [W] Wow, Cube City Hall is configured to use minikube.
00:37:17 [W] So as you can see minikube is successfully started now. You need to get add your changes.
00:37:27 [W] translations
00:37:31 [W] Minikube start from the all directly gonna work as a test. If you have different system local you can override the printed version using LC all environment variable.
00:37:34 [W] So I am using are Japanese.
00:37:34 [W] minikube start
00:37:34 [W] I'm starting minikube with dr.
00:37:35 [W] Drago.
00:37:35 [W] So as you can see, you are a translation for Japanese and minikube starting in Japanese. So it's verifying that kubenetes component now.
00:37:36 [W] Wow, Cube City Hall is configured to use minikube.
00:37:38 [W] So as you can see minikube is successfully started now. You need to get add your changes.
00:37:39 [W] and translations
00:37:39 [W] now get commit your changes.
00:37:39 [W] So write down your good commit messages over your so I added.
00:37:47 [W] translation
00:37:49 [W] for Japanese now just save this for pie.
00:37:59 [W] now you can push your changes to your
00:38:06 [W] look report.
00:38:08 [W] In my case. My local branch is head trance.
00:38:15 [W] No, it will boost all my changes to my local branch.
00:38:25 [W] Just copy paste the link.
00:38:34 [W] And up when in your browser.
00:38:40 [W] So it's loading.
00:38:51 [W] So you can write the description of your PR over here.
00:39:01 [W] Now get commit your changes.
00:39:03 [W] So write down your good commit messages over your so I added translation.
00:39:04 [W] for Japanese
00:39:04 [W] now just save this for pie.
00:39:04 [W] now you can push your changes to your
00:39:05 [W] Luke rapper
00:39:06 [W] in my case. My local branch is a trance.
00:39:06 [W] Now it will boost all my changes to my local branch.
00:39:07 [W] Just copy paste the link.
00:39:07 [W] And up open in your browser.
00:39:07 [W] So it's loading.
00:39:09 [W] So you can write the description of your PR over here.
00:39:10 [W] So add the translation.
00:39:10 [W] So you can create the pull request using Create pull request button. So your pull request will be successfully created.
00:39:32 [W] For the review process we use the community is guitar of review.
00:39:52 [W] So make your PR smaller so that it is easier to review so I have written commit messages in my PR so you can write good commit messages from here
00:40:05 [W] For the review process we use the community is guitar of review.
00:40:06 [W] So make your PR smaller so that it is easier to review so I have written commit messages in my PR so you can write good commit messages from here
00:40:07 [W] so if the minikube revealed as the LG TM approved level then pull request into the final mosque you
00:40:17 [W] so you can also contribute to our documentation.
00:40:23 [W] So every contribution is valuable so you can contribute to our documentation.
00:40:28 [W] You can either fix broken link or anything is much valuable.
00:40:31 [W] You can report the issue to the minikube repository as you can see.
00:40:37 [W] So we have minikube Trials take place every Wednesday from 11 a.m. PST so you can check out these links.
00:40:46 [W] So here is the process to report the bar to report a shoo-in minikube visit this report and click on new issues.
00:40:57 [W] So right detail about your issue and Ansel or required information so things to take care while reporting but you should not open issue for question.
00:41:09 [W] So while you are learning or playing with communities you may run into questions asked question on stack Overflow or server for it, but do not raise issues for question. So
00:41:16 [W] Thank you so much everybody.
00:41:18 [W] Thank you very much.
00:41:37 [W] The best time place where I would be Deus lie, let's continue with the rest of the presentation.
00:41:46 [W] So how if you remember the mental picture I guess as you guys to take which which was this one remember this one we support all of these combination of things. Please support
00:42:04 [W] Possible combination of Disguise. How do we not break them?
00:42:13 [W] And the thing is we do break though. But each time we break them.
00:42:14 [W] we add an integration test for it. So it's the last time we ever broke it.
00:42:19 [W] So, I mean we are not expert on all of those Technologies.
00:42:22 [W] The mutual was hyper-v.
00:42:24 [W] I gave you all of them.
00:42:26 [W] So each time we find a workaround for any of them. We either automatically do it for user or add it to a solution message, but the key is in-toto.
00:42:35 [W] Regression tests without integration tests. I would have not been able to remotely do any of the things you did in a minikube.
00:42:50 [W] So if you see in each minikube PR, we have 21 integration tests of different kinds for example, darker and windows darker and Mac OS hyper-v in Windows hipergator Mac OS and each of those integration test is about
00:42:58 [W] Some of them take an hour or I'm sorry, 40 minutes. So we invested in testing and is the one tool that came out of minikube today belt over hack-a-thon and when we were
00:43:15 [W] Looking at integration test result is how it looks like from 200 integration tests.
00:43:23 [W] Let's say something of failed you want to find that it was difficult.
00:43:33 [W] And so what if we could convert that to HTML, so this is HTML version of the same technique the same test that you side you can see it's full of oil and you can see the all the past ones and you can sort them
00:43:41 [W] So you can see this is and then you can search with it and open it in a new window copy the logs folder payment link. So this is done by GoPro rook and Goldberg initially named It Go pretty
00:43:58 [W] Is done by Goldberg and Goldberg initially named It Go pretty and then it just other completed myself go pretty or go home.
00:44:03 [W] It was a hack-a-thon ideas.
00:44:05 [W] I just came up with a quick name and just became Goldberg and we use go poke in our integration tests to convert that text Golan test output text to HTML one, which makes our life so much easier to
00:44:19 [W] The tests because you have so many tests on all those platforms hundreds of them and makes it much easier for us.
00:44:30 [W] Other than a unit tests and integration tests. You also have the kubernative conformance tests.
00:44:43 [W] We also have ISO and base image the as ISO for the VM and based image, Florida kick drivers Docker and Padma and he also recently added a stress test.
00:44:52 [W] So we had a bog in minikube that we notice if you have many Target every day the same time we had a specific issue.
00:44:58 [W] And he said how about you make that issue never happen again?
00:45:03 [W] We write a test right and forget about it.
00:45:10 [W] So each time we make a PR the testing infrastructure helps us to catch them and we develop like I would say an Empire of testing really we have so many VMS in Google cloud and
00:45:20 [W] Sig windows and thank you so much for a sec Windows to hooking up us with Windows VMS in Azure.
00:45:34 [W] So now we test Windows Visa not have test windows and now we do tests in parallel one year ago.
00:45:37 [W] We were not doin tests in parallel.
00:45:48 [W] No the test as opposed to one hour and a half. It takes 30 minutes or 40 minutes, but we do way more testing in more testing because we do the tests in parallel. We have actually taken a very
00:45:52 [W] One hour and a half. It takes 30 minutes or 40 minutes, but we do way more testing in more testing because we do the tests in parallel.
00:46:51 [W] We have actually taking a very good advantage of GitHub actions and speaking of get up actions.
00:46:52 [W] I have a very happy announcement to make that we published setup minikube GitHub action.
00:46:53 [W] So now in your work development, you can actually have minikube run ended up actions by adding three lines just say uses media GH / set up - minikube
00:46:55 [W] This is an example of a flag that minikube supports weight - all it means wait for everything possible before you after you start the minikube cluster and verify everything that way you don't have to add those Time Slips in your scripts in the
00:47:06 [W] Add those Time Slips in your scripts in the ci/cd x + delete on failure means if for some reason the cluster failed is okay, delete it and recreate it. And this way you give us permission to delete your closet if it was a
00:47:18 [W] That recreated and this way you give us permission to delete your class or if it was a failure on it and just recreate it because most of the times that fixes it and interactive forces means Sometimes some drivers needs prompt for passport or something like that
00:47:28 [W] Primed for passport or something like that in CIA say interactive Falls is hey, this is going to be no human to type anything don't prompt us for anything is an example of running. Minikube.
00:47:41 [W] NCI the way this how this setup minikube could have action in when we implemented it we use those for you.
00:47:48 [W] Minikube speaks your language. We saw that Rohit showed us how to add Japanese language.
00:47:57 [W] This is minikube speaking French or issue templates.
00:47:59 [W] We have issue members in multiple languages.
00:48:02 [W] We accept contribution from all languages.
00:48:10 [W] You can see sometimes we actually respond in the language using Google translate. The sheriff was responding to a Chinese user in Chinese. And also we respect the users from all kinds of environments corporate environments
00:48:17 [W] We accept contributions from all languages.
00:48:19 [W] You can see sometimes we actually respond in the language using Google translate Sheriff was responding to a Chinese user in Chinese.
00:48:20 [W] And also we respect the users from all kinds of environments corporate environments countries with low access to Internet countries with restricted access to GCR. Anybody
00:48:25 [W] Sister internet countries with restricted access to GCR. Anybody we try to make sure everybody can access sighs. We have detections how to help them to run minikube in
00:48:33 [W] Environments and also we we have a tool called trash party that also graduated from minikube project and I encourage you to come with us.
00:48:48 [W] We have a triage party every Wednesday.
00:48:48 [W] You can come play with us.
00:48:54 [W] I will let you read more about it because you're running out of time.
00:48:57 [W] is a tool that we wrote to help us triage the minikube issues we have
00:49:00 [W] Ton, we have tens of thousands of users. If you didn't have a tool like trash party, we would be overwhelmed how to respond to all of those issues and in a timely manner.
00:49:14 [W] This is a link to all of the tools in it m and shinned in this slide and also the link to the slack take a look at them.
00:49:25 [W] By the way. We have surveys on every release notes if you click on it, we do listen to the surveys. This is a survey from 2020 q1 the top.
00:49:30 [W] Two categories that people asked us to improve on was multi-node and V Humphrey and then the next choir when we delivered those things and fix all the bugs bread.
00:49:43 [W] We saw that there is none of them anymore.
00:49:47 [W] people we listen to your surveys implemented and you you give us a feedback that he has you you did a good job listening to us.
00:49:54 [W] So, please fill out those a lot of surveys. We totally listen to them.
00:49:59 [W] We have more 1500 surveys.
00:50:02 [W] What's coming next I GUI Auto Parts. I talked about the pause command, but it would be cool that minikube automatically pause it for you. So you don't have to posit very yourself and running minikube one Chromebook.
00:50:20 [W] I think that would be cool for a full list. Look at our public road map.
00:50:26 [W] In search of all our previous website was a limit.
00:50:31 [W] not very good.
00:50:32 [W] We have a new website simplified.
00:50:35 [W] It's a terrible actually, but this one I think you would like this one better.
00:50:43 [W] Well, thank you so much everybody for listening to this talk and I talked very fast.
00:50:46 [W] It was a very compressed doc. I hope I didn't make you guys be sick of minikube by my talking so fast and throwing so much information.
00:50:55 [W] And so quickly and thank you very much for watching this and would be available for any questions that you might have.
00:51:05 [W] Thank you very much.
