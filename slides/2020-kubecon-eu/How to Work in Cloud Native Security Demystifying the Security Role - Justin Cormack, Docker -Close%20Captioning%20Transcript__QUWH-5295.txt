00:00:57 [W] Hello everybody.
00:07:50 [W] I'm here today to talk about how to work in Cloud native security and what the security role involves and how to get involved if you want to move into security.
00:08:02 [W] If you don't know me, I'm just in comic I've been a doctor for five years now as an engineer.
00:08:08 [W] I'm also on the cncf canonical oversight committee. I live in
00:08:14 [W] Cambridge UK and I'm adjusting her mic on most of the internet.
00:08:21 [W] I'm so I'm quite easy to find if you remember my name.
00:08:22 [W] This is Cambridge.
00:08:27 [W] It's up the road from where I live where I've been spending my time in lockdown.
00:08:32 [W] This is sort of kind of I like to say Cambridge as a kind of Tech Village.
00:08:44 [W] It's really got technology and farms and Fields right next to each other which is kind of nice.
00:08:52 [W] There's a radio telescopes where I live right by where pulsars were discovered.
00:08:54 [W] As a guy I kind of got into security by mistake. I didn't have a set out to be a security person.
00:09:03 [W] So on the cncf technical oversight committee, I live in Cambridge UK and I'm adjusting your mic on most of the internet.
00:09:12 [W] I'm so I'm quite easy to find if you remember my name.
00:09:12 [W] This is Cambridge.
00:09:13 [W] It's up the road from where I live where I've been spending my time in lockdown.
00:09:13 [W] This is sort of kind of I like to say Cambridge as a kind of Tech Village.
00:09:16 [W] It's really got technology and farms and Fields right next to each other which is kind of nice.
00:09:17 [W] There's a radio telescopes where I live right by where pulsars were discovered.
00:09:19 [W] As a guy I kind of got into security by mistake. I didn't have a set out to be a security person.
00:09:30 [W] So I think I probably got quite a good idea about how to get there by mistake if you want to get there by mistake or even on purpose.
00:09:30 [W] I I started off being exposed to security for the first time really when I was many years ago.
00:09:31 [W] I was at University.
00:09:31 [W] I was working as a sysadmin and every machine
00:09:33 [W] had a public IP address and that really did make us a interesting Target for people not really to hack us. They went down to his house, but I'm mainly interested in her.
00:09:36 [W] Getting our bandwidth and being able to hack other things from there.
00:09:38 [W] I thought the role will be mostly about configuration management and stuff like that. But actually there was turned out to be a lot of security into it after that.
00:09:49 [W] I kind of drifted away from that studying other things. I moved into development.
00:09:50 [W] I worked in financial services got exposed to risk management and the idea of you know, taking, you know taking calculated risks, which was a useful idea from the security point of view.
00:10:04 [W] And I spent a lot of time learning the internals of things which I think is really useful.
00:10:10 [W] I spent a lot of time in the internals of Linux when I was working on, you know kernels you have to understand Linux if you're trying to replace it and I did write some fun blog post like 11 says called the
00:10:24 [W] the rock the world, you know just about the Obscure corners of that world, you know, it's kind of, you know, kind of fun and there's a lot of detail and things inside this useful to know
00:10:40 [W] I was a darker I the first security-related thing. I did was work with Jay-Z Frizzell on the sitcom filtering for darker.
00:10:51 [W] I still maintain that it's kind of interesting actually going to spend some time working on a her bit more rewriting the policy about from The Experience we've had as
00:11:02 [W] Interesting because given us is has been trying to build a standard seccomp policy for some years now and this has been taking a long time and I but it is an interesting area so and it really helps
00:11:17 [W] Is that this is going to cause that you're filtering there about three years ago.
00:11:25 [W] I moved full-time on to the security team at darker and then I'm led the security team for a while and now I'm back to not just doing security.
00:11:36 [W] I also do I'm a become a generalist again.
00:11:45 [W] I'm a senior engineer across everything we do it darker. So kind of moved around turn from security my career.
00:11:47 [W] I'm also involved a lot in the security Community.
00:12:01 [W] I was particularly with cncf Sig security that started a couple of years ago as a safe working group, and then we turned it into an official cncf group and has become very successful, so
00:12:08 [W] Group, and it's become very successful.
00:12:11 [W] So to get involved if you're interested, we got toxic give kind of gross and it's we Face likely been involved in, you know working with cncf
00:12:19 [W] Working with the end user community on security and helping them get involved and and helping that there is a review projects for security and having the Project's themselves understand security.
00:12:36 [W] I also am maintainer of nitrate which is cncf project and I've been spending all the time since November also working on notary V2, which is a rewrite and reworking of the old security model for
00:12:49 [W] Hang with Amazon Microsoft New York University and other people say that's really been a really interesting project and good fun.
00:13:02 [W] Again. We have toxic you've gone about that.
00:13:03 [W] So come along listen to them.
00:13:10 [W] them. I'm a security advisor for containerd e now the containerd a project so that's a new role.
00:13:12 [W] Also sprinkled all the time bringing security to a wider Community rather than tracks at UConn New York last year from which these two talks were from the maintaining the go crypto libraries, which was by Filippo.
00:13:28 [W] I was really interested in having a talk about what maintenance is about in a send security not just writing new things and you know developing new protocols, but actually just maintaining a the world of cryptography.
00:13:42 [W] The and uses in the program language uses great talk and Kate cells talk on making npm install safe, which is over all about programming language security how we can make it so that you can import something with npm, but it doesn't have capabilities to
00:13:57 [W] Install safe, which is a little bit about programming language security how we can make it so that you can import something with npm, but it doesn't have capabilities to do so own everything in your in your program and do anything it wants.
00:14:02 [W] So how can we restrict capabilities? So again another great dog? I think these kinds of things are very important in terms of bringing security to a wider audience.
00:14:14 [W] As I watch on the noise protocol framework, which is a kind of alternatives to TLs, but based on simple cryptographic Primitives is really learned an awful lot.
00:14:28 [W] Just helping work on the spec and then pieces around that I was I got an interesting capability-based security have done some talks on that kind of neglected areas of security. I guess there's lots to learn and I think that learning
00:14:39 [W] Area is really important.
00:14:49 [W] You know, it's give you a better perspective on what's going on and why things are like that and what the problems with security actually are.
00:14:50 [W] The most important things you can learn I think insecurity.
00:15:02 [W] I talked about, you know, dying sort of vision goals and things and networking now in some areas in detail is incredibly important both for offensive and defensive security.
00:15:12 [W] You need to know the, you know, the sharp corners and the difficult beds and the unknown bits and the bits that people can exploit and that really means diving down.
00:15:22 [W] Deeply into how things work and not just having a kind of casual surface.
00:15:31 [W] I know how to use the library of to do this, but I don't really understand the internals because it that's like is the bits that are not doing what they're supposed to do their important in security and this is the bed that really separates the people who can write
00:15:42 [W] Where is he and this is the bit that really separates the people who can write new exploits or fix things that are difficult from the people who can just run a script, you know, security issues of the real boundaries of the usual and you to play around
00:15:53 [W] fix things get deep inside the internals and you know, the protocols and the implementations and and so on so there's there's a lot of detail work that's important,
00:16:10 [W] It's about k8s Securities very much.
00:16:15 [W] Not a bad code it it's important to spend time in the real world with real people who are using Code using computers. You have got problems feel empathy for them and understand what their problems are and what they are trying to solve.
00:16:28 [W] It's it's most of the time people don't think about security don't care about it.
00:16:42 [W] It's not an important thing and you know, it's not something they deal with on a daily basis.
00:16:51 [W] So you have to not be the person who comes along and like in this drawing just you know, locks things up and takes away the key and says, this is secure now because I've got the gear and you haven't you know, the best security is there supporting how people
00:16:57 [W] Making them do making things difficult for them and that's really really important.
00:17:02 [W] That's what you're trying to do. You're trying to help people.
00:17:05 [W] You're not trying to lock things up. The follow on from that slide is this slide where you know, the user can't use the locked up cooker, which is all nice and safe and secure but has to improvise and then
00:17:19 [W] On fire and that's you know, the reality is that users have to get things done. And if they have to get things done by with the tools they have they will and those tools might not be so suitable. So
00:17:33 [W] you need to be you need to be working with what people are doing and understanding what they're doing and not just being in sitting and long isolated saying what they should be doing.
00:17:48 [W] Also. I think it's really important to both break things and fix things as a sort of divided in the security World between the black hat white hat, you know, the breaking things and fixing things.
00:18:00 [W] It's a not actually a Great Divide. I think that just breaking things is not
00:18:03 [W] sufficient to Bear fully rounded security person you need to also that has a fix things because it's actually difficult there's compromises and the messy real world things were talking about, you know,
00:18:18 [W] Price to the lenses kernel mailing list recently saying please don't send us any more security issues you found with a fuzzing tools because we've got loads of them already.
00:18:33 [W] We actually just need help fixing that and not breaking things.
00:18:45 [W] You know, it's a it's a balance, you know, you can write automated tools that break things quite easily and then find thousands of errors but fixing them is working people have to do that work and it's important that you're one of those people.
00:18:47 [W] who does that work not the person who comes along and
00:18:48 [W] and just tells people they have work to do help them out help you help your colleagues out wanting, you know being angry about the state of the world from the security point of view is kind of good in a way because we have to get it better, but
00:19:03 [W] That is not the answer.
00:19:08 [W] We really, you know, you got to work how we fix the stuff that's there how we encourage people to change how they do things and so on so there's breaking and fixing and working with the other people is really important working
00:19:22 [W] Is very important in working in security is not just an engineering job.
00:19:30 [W] You get to meet everyone else in the company as well.
00:19:33 [W] You guys have meet your lawyers.
00:19:40 [W] These are these people are lovely people to work with, you know, they have to get to know them.
00:19:41 [W] You have to understand how they work and how that what they want you to write things down or not write things down and that's really, you know, not Kudo I got way more exposure to lawyers when I was working in.
00:19:53 [W] In security than before, you'll meet your PR team because security issues. Our communication is used to as likely to work with a really great woman who had worked
00:20:08 [W] Because I work with a really great woman who had worked at Intel doing Spectrum meltdown. She was you really had a was going to keeping calm and what you how to communicate things really really good to learn
00:20:18 [W] But say if that's important to you know security is a you know, security instance and things are difficult stories to tell and difficult things to explain and it's difficult work and there are people
00:20:35 [W] This so you need to work with them. If the cells security is a business. You have to explain to people why it matters in which things matter more and which risks are important in which it's not so important again, that's it's about balance
00:20:50 [W] Artis and compromises and watch things to do now and which things to do later?
00:21:00 [W] You can't have there's no point having everyone you're just spending the time doing security fixes if you then run out of money, but then on the other hand when things are important they have to get down and it's important
00:21:10 [W] about those things and security products and really interesting part of work to and just adding security features two products that you have to be able to work with the product team and work out which things would
00:21:27 [W] Right and then so and so there's a whole lot of product work. That's really interesting and you need to get involved in as well.
00:21:43 [W] So thinking of it as as just a an engineering job where you sit down and just hack on things is not really, you know, the whole of the role and it's really important to to understand that and think
00:21:48 [W] Those other parts of the world as well.
00:21:50 [W] There's a lot of demand for security people.
00:22:02 [W] The estimate I could find was that they would be three and a half million unfilled security jobs worldwide in 2021.
00:22:09 [W] I don't know if that figures really accurate or what it means and you know other they're going to be, you know, three and a half million jobs.
00:22:17 [W] don't go field what happens and so on but I mean it's it is an increasingly important area.
00:22:21 [W] Definitely hard to hire people.
00:22:37 [W] I spend a lot of time doing hiring and it's really difficult to find people and so I do believe there's a shortage and you know salaries are good and security and and I don't know that entirely
00:22:39 [W] In shortage or anything, but you know, it is definitely a role where there is definitely demand and you don't need formal security qualifications.
00:22:55 [W] You don't know to being a kind of hacker who's hacked high-profile websites and been arrested or anything.
00:23:02 [W] You don't need to be a great developer to work in security either necessarily you need to be able to and I think that for all kind of roles in Computing being able to code
00:23:11 [W] Is useful, but reading code is a really important skill and security you've got to be able to understand other people's code find bugs and other people's code find security issues. In other people's code So reading code is actually
00:23:25 [W] Ending kind finding things that are likely to be a problem being of the find out where in the code they're implemented. If you're you know Finding issues in open source code which a lot of the time you are now rather than closed source code you
00:23:40 [W] spend less time actually reverse engineering what the code is and more finding issues, which is really important thing to be able to do there are formal qualifications, but you know, I I've never had any I don't think that
00:23:56 [W] That's all.
00:23:59 [W] so what what in particular back Cloud native security wise Cloud native security different and important now and why is it, you know something that we talk about specifically
00:24:14 [W] everything is cloud and Cloud knative. It's the
00:24:24 [W] really important thing before glad native.
00:24:40 [W] We actually had a you know with there was a thing like that was Hardware security and Hardware security was kind of, you know firewalls were, you know, physically wired up with cables.
00:24:40 [W] there was this amazing thing called the data diode, which is kind of weird bit of History.
00:24:50 [W] still exist in some cases, but it was a one-way network cable where you could send things but not receive things or vice versa designs. Oh that
00:24:57 [W] I took a tiny flowmill One Direction, you know if they have to use Network protocols that don't have ax because you're going to make a thing that only acts can flow back, but
00:25:10 [W] You can send UDP packets out one way and you know, these were kind of hard work scares you magnesium's but nothing really works like that anymore.
00:25:23 [W] Your firewall is just another piece of software. You are your crab Rider, you know, it's just as networking that you can reconfigure in any way you want you can make any type of service
00:25:35 [W] All right, you know it's just as networking that you can reconfigure in any way you want you can make any type of service talk to any service if you just rewire the infrastructure so
00:25:41 [W] So everything's just Kade so you can't there's no sharp separation anymore.
00:25:49 [W] So there's really changes everything about security because it changes.
00:25:52 [W] You know, what what matters of ask here is changes, you know, the separation of concerns.
00:26:02 [W] you can't separate security from development and operations anymore. We have this kind of Dev seccomp side are now that you know operations development and security have to work together because
00:26:09 [W] As there isn't there are these hard physical lines where think can't cross things can only go in One Direction. You have to program them to only go in One Direction.
00:26:24 [W] Also, everything is checked can change much more quickly.
00:26:25 [W] You can redeploy code multiple times a day and each of those redeploys could break the security model.
00:26:39 [W] model. So there's you know, you have to be there's no kind of, you know review panel once or quarters for security changes or anything like that everything has
00:26:41 [W] To be tested up in real time.
00:26:47 [W] There's new places to attack supply chain attacks have become real Focus recently because if everything's code, well well if you can modify the code or modify the way that the code is being up the
00:26:58 [W] To another computer then you can basically change everything's been deployed and add back doors or remove security pieces or whatever.
00:27:11 [W] So everyone has to get involved in this together now.
00:27:12 [W] This chart comes from the sneak Dev seccomp.
00:27:42 [W] So both is cares he both and the software and an infrastructure, you know, so we're not there yet.
00:27:51 [W] It's important to you know on as your journey to the to being someone who works in security if you're working as a developer now, you know, one of the things you can do is just spend time working and understanding the security in the code. You work on
00:28:04 [W] the threat model the threat modeling Burke by Adam szustak is is really good just understand how to think about threat models think about which bits of your arcade matter where who's respondent which bit of
00:28:20 [W] we'll fly protecting what that just is really a bunch of so, you know, take that time and think about the you know, the domain and what
00:28:31 [W] what your what what your security risks and threats actually our security is really a kind of thing is is a kind of code quality.
00:28:47 [W] It's an interesting kind of code quality because you know code that always does the right thing even in bad circumstances is secure code and quality code.
00:28:57 [W] So just handling errors handling the unexpected things in a secure way as important, you know, if you just ignore errors and carry on then someone canonical
00:29:01 [W] Is that as I said, it's part of an attack you need to understand the issues in the you know in the domain you're working and if you're working on websites, you know, cross-site scripting and all those things are things that you should be.
00:29:17 [W] You know, they have a security problems in your field that you should understand and understand where they come from and how understand how you fix them and understand how you how you can either test for them or not make those mistakes in the first
00:29:29 [W] Libraries, you can use other techniques you can use to not have those errors and can you write you know, you should write security tests.
00:29:42 [W] It's really important to have tests for security. So that security critical things don't break again in future again, you know, as you roll out code, you don't want some security some vital security thing to be missed out because of it doesn't get
00:29:53 [W] Doesn't get deployed correctly or whatever.
00:29:57 [W] Some of those tests should be, you know, when you're building a career, but he also runtime tests are really useful to make sure that if something doesn't get deployed that leaves your security open, you don't want to
00:30:10 [W] How can I used it's worth spending time to think like an attacker.
00:30:18 [W] that was actually one of the things I did know one previous role. I'd spare allocate some time on Mid mid Monday morning to find security bugs in the product.
00:30:28 [W] I was working on and you know some it's about a spend an hour or two each week and try and attack it and sometimes you'd find something.
00:30:37 [W] Sometimes it would be a dead end.
00:30:38 [W] You wouldn't get anywhere. Sometimes you would find you.
00:30:42 [W] Couldn't find anything but you if you don't think like an attacker, he won't ever explore those parts of your program and actually as a developer you often know where the where the things are that you think that they might be weaknesses because they're things you
00:30:55 [W] And about when you're developing them, maybe there's a to do in the code that shouldn't be there. So spend time doing that and also learn from external audits external audits are really valuable because those are other people looking at your code and you can
00:31:11 [W] Other people look at you.
00:31:15 [W] Okay, and the things that they find you know, what kind of problems that might be and learn more about security from that and help you on your journey towards becoming a security person.
00:31:23 [W] Another thing I really need to talk about is burnout burnout is an area that particularly affects people who work in security.
00:31:39 [W] I think I mean effects or all of us of course and you know, it's an important thing to be aware of but in security roles in particular often, you're working in a kind of isolated environment where you can't talk to people about your work sometimes because it's
00:31:46 [W] You're working on things that can't be disclosed.
00:31:51 [W] Yes, or can't I won't ever be disclosed.
00:31:53 [W] So that's kind of isolating often because difficulties in hiring there aren't enough people in security. So you might be overworked and common cause of burnout and you kind of living away from the happy path, you know,
00:32:08 [W] Pathan in programming as you know, where everything works as intended. It's the things that you may spend my time writing tests for security.
00:32:21 [W] People are thinking about all the unhappy things and it kind of living away from that people become paranoid about attackers.
00:32:26 [W] The attackers are out to get you it's, you know can be a problem as well.
00:32:34 [W] well. So it's really important to find friends outside security and outside your out completely outside your work.
00:32:39 [W] Work here. You can you know spend time with and it's also important to find a community inside security as well.
00:32:46 [W] don't feel kind of so so alone and you have other people you can talk to you about the kinds of things that you're concerned about.
00:32:54 [W] So, thanks very much.
00:32:56 [W] Keep connected.
00:32:59 [W] I'm just in come back stay in touch.
00:33:00 [W] I'm happy to always talk talk to you directly if you want to get in touch with me.
00:33:08 [W] Thanks listeners dark, and it's enjoy the rest of you come.
00:33:08 [W] Thanks.
00:33:09 [W] Hello nice to you all thanks for all the questions so got a bunch of questions, so please do join the slack Channel if you if I haven't answered your question and I'll make sure it's cash out there
00:33:28 [W] I have quite long answer so I would be great to chat there about them.
00:33:34 [W] So I'm starting a masters and security and network engineering in two weeks.
00:33:49 [W] What was interesting areas. You see someone and academic positions and could look at now.
00:33:57 [W] This is a great question and I'd love to talk to you about this morons like as well because it's I've got a lot to talk about. I actually spent quite a lot of time working with academics working on security.
00:34:04 [W] security. And so I've got a lot of opinions on that and I've worked with some really great people with the
00:34:10 [W] Nitrate project and tough.
00:34:16 [W] We work with New York University. I know I've worked with bunch of people in Cambridge and Imperial and London and so on and I've got a lot of ideas, but it's probably best. This is probably isn't the best place to give you a look as I've suggested, but I'd be really happy to talk to you about that in a lots of details, so please
00:34:26 [W] I'm visit the slack Channel nikhil asks is my understanding correct? Not to run CLI commands inside the classroom apart, but on some other laptop outside the part and
00:34:42 [W] Like I'm a big believer that users shouldn't be running stuff directly as a user inside the communities class bof possible.
00:34:58 [W] I'm a I'm a really strong believer in automation for running across as I think that giving users direct access is not the right answer long term.
00:35:10 [W] I it is useful and helpful in the short term and but I mean, I'm a
00:35:12 [W] Really big believer that gitops is a really good design for security where essentially you're trying to do things through automation. Not through manually using a CLI. So my recommendation would be to kind of think about how
00:35:28 [W] Fine for security where essentially you're trying to do things through automation, not through manually using a CLI. So my recommendation would be to kind of think about how you could automate these things you're doing by hand
00:35:32 [W] If you're if you are creating things in the CLI that you know, basically look at what you're doing there again have to talk about that more on slack another question
00:35:47 [W] Related question around should I use kubernative Zar back for applications here lies, or should I actually you know use a separate set of authentication? And now this is a question that I think we really
00:36:03 [W] I haven't been very good at explaining how the good ways of doing this and what's going on.
00:36:13 [W] And I think this is a really complicated area.
00:36:16 [W] So it's interesting even looking at the cloud providers.
00:36:28 [W] So Microsoft and Google or kind of have user accounts as there often as your has kind of basically kind of more machine oriented things, and I'm I'm kind.
00:36:31 [W] It kind of depends exactly what you'll see allies for is it an admin CLI or for users? But generally for users the users of your of your applications and not the same set of users as you have four.
00:36:48 [W] Have for admin and and in general it's not usually going to be the same as other people. So if you think about it, like do you want your end users to actually have to have say Amazon
00:37:01 [W] Answer is generally no you want to separate and user system.
00:37:07 [W] Probably related to your business set up like your active directory or whatever for your user authentication and that should be separate from the kubernetes our bag, which is largely about
00:37:20 [W] And systems accessing it.
00:37:31 [W] I think we've done a very bad job insecurity of explaining these kinds of differences between system accounts and user accounts, and we need to do more on that.
00:37:34 [W] So, oh, please I'm happy to again. Ask answer more questions about that write any book recommendations for kubernative security while is rice has just come out with a book so I would say I have
00:37:47 [W] Yeah, but I'm sure it's excellent.
00:37:55 [W] It is a field where books do go out of date.
00:37:55 [W] really quickly. And if you think about what a book about cabin is security a year ago versus now would be it books are a difficult thing for the fast-moving project like this so so but recent
00:38:10 [W] Head but it's a books is not necessarily what you want, but there's loads of great resources.
00:38:18 [W] Yeah.
00:38:21 [W] bring on some slack.
00:38:24 [W] There was a comment about thanks to the motion of burnout and paranoia and happy to hear this is not uncommon.
00:38:36 [W] Yeah, it's really important to understand this.
00:38:38 [W] I I've seen it a lot in security people.
00:38:40 [W] I know a lot of X security people.
00:38:51 [W] It's a field that people do leave unhappily. And so yeah, it's I don't think anyone should talk about these things without mentioning it and and really thinking about
00:38:55 [W] Out that from your personal point of view is really important.
00:39:01 [W] There's a question about what are called patterns of you seen to make development with security by default easier things like local em TLS.
00:39:20 [W] It's interesting about M2M TLS is something that I've spent quite a lot of time where it's because we use that a lot particularly on our darker Enterprise Products. Now the mirantis product we use
00:39:28 [W] hls and day darker was set up to use Mutual TLS as for remote login and things like that, but it's been really hard to have users use the successfully and I'm so I think the answer is the like
00:39:43 [W] widespread Mutual TLS is is effectively that I have not seen a workable solution to this and I'm a really I think it's a very very difficult area to
00:39:58 [W] Make it work. Well, and I'm kind of not sure. You know, I'm not sure if it's the right solution and for something that works easily and
00:40:14 [W] It's I think we're getting a little bit better at Sea. I mean the steps we've made in tlso. Let's encrypt which has made website TLS work. Well the
00:40:26 [W] I think that servicemeshcon one of their main use cases has been to make between application TLS work transparently and well, but we are still really missing tooling for the other tell us use cases. And I think it's something is definitely worth working
00:40:41 [W] I was going about my slides I have now uploaded My Side Story while their stock was going on.
00:40:50 [W] I really apologize for not having done that earlier.
00:41:03 [W] I think that we're about out of time. So but do comes just like Channel. I've got really happy to answer your questions there and it really if you want to direct message me or ask anything about your career and things that you're concerned
00:41:06 [W] About and if you'd like help, please please be in touch. The cncf slack is a great place to contact me and I'm really happy, you know, if you got more personal questions or the general questions as thread in the
00:41:21 [W] Slag should be running just after this talk and I'll be I'll be there to answer questions because I think bit just about to run out of time.
00:41:31 [W] So, thanks all.
