00:01:19 [W] Hello everyone. My name is tamas Irish and I
00:01:23 [W] How do we enable end to end of severability Why open source in 5 GTA corsi NFC NFC if you haven't heard the term before stands for cloud native Network functions. So let's dive right into it a bit
00:07:34 [W] A bit about the journey we are from Erickson and and we have a very extensive experience in building platforms or the monolithic type that sort of makes software and Hardware work as efficiently together
00:07:50 [W] Possible.
00:07:55 [W] So we used in the past and we're still using Hardware acceleration a six customers is Kernel modules, you know, you name it we have it and we build software and Hardware together to make it work as efficiently as possible.
00:08:06 [W] over there are quite many use cases where we have sort of moved away from that Paradigm moved away from the monolithic Bay of building things where we sort of run hardware and software together when we started using extensively
00:08:21 [W] Software in the cloud knative computing Foundation mostly in the landscape and mostly open source projects and and since we wanted to enable software development in a really cloud native a inside of Ericsson, we have decided
00:08:37 [W] to build a framework out of some of the selected software that we take from open source projects and enable them within Eric Stone to be used for technical purposes for very very,
00:08:52 [W] On the use cases and applications of course all the software did we take we don't for Kit.
00:09:03 [W] We don't modify it if we have to modify it. We work together with the community and contribute Vector changes and sort of implement an upstream first strategies.
00:09:14 [W] So we try to help the community as much as we can wherever there are, you know things lacking in other areas. We just take the software and make sure that they can fulfill the
00:09:24 [W] very strict requirements that require application is are sometimes put against so what are these use cases?
00:09:31 [W] And what are these demanding use cases and applications?
00:09:33 [W] Well, let's see 4 5 G if we look at the 5 G core part there is the use of playing for mobile broadband.
00:09:47 [W] broadband. For example, mobile broadband is basically all of the network traffic that goes through mobile phones all the streaming over the videos.
00:09:54 [W] Your emails your you know, when you're working from home potentially all that traffic goes through these Network functions.
00:10:07 [W] So they of course have very very very strict requirements on availability or on one service continuity, but also on network throughput otherwise, they wouldn't be able to handle, you know the network
00:10:17 [W] who will country or for a complete region when it comes to mobile broadband, but I can also mention another application where we where we create a management application that takes care of the management of the complete radio network which
00:10:32 [W] It's of thousands. If not tens of thousands of network elements that all needs to be configured and managed from the software perspective.
00:10:43 [W] and of course monitored and have checked continuously within the network to keep that Network operational that again generates a lot of traffic going towards the management nodes and those
00:10:56 [W] Have to use the same software because the software leaves in the core.
00:11:03 [W] I can mention radio equipment some of the radiologic now, we are moving onto this platform this framework that we have created out of cncf software private networks of education's and so on so it's it's
00:11:16 [W] We diverse set of different applications all with mostly very demanding requirements on the platform and and everything else around it.
00:11:31 [W] We have recently started using this platform for the 6G test bed. But that is of course just a test bed. So what we are going something most on his 5G, then of course everything that we do
00:11:41 [W] Knative lie on top of this framework needs to fit in existing environments existing Telco operators real working and Paradigm. And and and and so since these are very complex.
00:11:56 [W] Is made out of many many Network elements.
00:12:03 [W] It's necessary to have some sort of management framework that keeps everything together.
00:12:08 [W] And this is where another Linux Foundation project the Open Network application platform projects comes into the picture because that projects implements a very capable management system that can sort of take care of
00:12:20 [W] Of the cloud is lost infrastructure, but also the applications and the transport and that helps us to sort of feed our Cloud native applications into a traditional Telecom environment.
00:12:36 [W] What is the exact nature of the challenge?
00:12:37 [W] Well, let me show you a typical Telecom Operator by software from many vendors.
00:12:50 [W] And if you look at the complete stack that is true for the different layers of the stack. So
00:12:52 [W] I try to show you in this picture the fundamental difference between a typical Cloud native stack that you know, unknown Telco player might do versus what the Telecom operators needs to deal with.
00:13:05 [W] So in a typical Cloud native stack and let me try to draw here a developer ticks some sort of cloud infrastructure bias capacity from a cloud infrastructure and then
00:13:19 [W] their own choice of kubernative distribution chooses some of the platform Services maybe builds builds a platform out of those creates the business logic and then if necessary, if the applications complexity really warrants it
00:13:35 [W] Creates Management Services, but everything is in one hand everything that is blue is coming from one player and the cloud influence coming from someone else in the Telecom word. The Telecom operator wants to go out and buy software from
00:13:50 [W] Vendors so they might be Cloud infrastructure from one vendor or they might build their own cloud infrastructure quite typically Telecom operators have a private cloud and either they build it themselves or ask then door for one.
00:14:06 [W] Those are kubernative distribution and usually the kubernative distribution comes with certain services and in a good case or that and the business logic might be coming from one single vendor. So everything that is blue here is coming from that safe from
00:14:20 [W] External whoever else then very typical that the oss the management system and and the BSS the business management system is coming from another vendor.
00:14:36 [W] So it's a it's an orange one door and the light will bend or this is sort of the best case scenario the worst case scenario could look like Claudia flow from someone kubernative with some services from someone else then some business logic
00:14:47 [W] From another vendor or multiple vendors together with some of the some services from the cncf landscape and of course OSS and BSS and separately all these needs to work together without extensive integration
00:15:02 [W] Checked because that would be just not cost efficient and what we have been relying on so far for many many years is of course standardization and we participate in standardization and The Operators
00:15:17 [W] You standardization be together creative things like 3gpp there. We agree on the interfaces.
00:15:29 [W] So even if the an operator gets software from many different vendors, it should work well together when it's integrated together. Then of course standardization can be a slow thing and and can be accomplished something and
00:15:38 [W] Ahead at a very fast pace.
00:15:43 [W] So what we have been trying to do as much as possible is to try to to refer to Industry standards.
00:15:52 [W] And and in many many many ways industry standards the standards these days are dictated by open source projects. So I'll come back to this point. But here it is super important to have things like the cncf
00:16:04 [W] Have the cloud native compute foundation and have owned up that sort of creates a common denominator across the industry.
00:16:13 [W] So how does this stack look like?
00:16:19 [W] I mentioned the application development framework here. You see the input for that is the cncf landscape and you know, these logos should be very very familiar to you.
00:16:29 [W] So I will not go through these in detail the idea.
00:16:31 [W] is that all of these highly demanding applications can be built on top of this framework.
00:16:37 [W] not just Network functions, which are standardized by 3gpp, but also any sort of application and aqua blue.
00:16:43 [W] Shawn can be built on top of this this framework then inside the framework.
00:16:51 [W] We are sort of grouping things into different different groups. We have things that that take care of lifecycle management. We have of course databases which are super important since quite many of the Telecom applications are very very stateful
00:17:03 [W] Those States need to be stored somewhere in a cloud friendly way.
00:17:15 [W] So what we do we take on databases into the framework and we ensure that we can lifecycle manage those databases using for example, kubernative operators configuration management Performance Management and forth management.
00:17:25 [W] These are very traditional typical Telco things.
00:17:29 [W] I need to be able to configure my network so I can set up the necessary interfaces and timers and
00:17:34 [W] Behavior of the network Performance Management is basically monitoring looking at all the kpis and making sure my system is operating perfectly and forward management is when things go wrong.
00:17:49 [W] I want exact indications about what has what went wrong and I need to see you know these in priority order in my management system.
00:18:00 [W] So I I or the ones who is managing the system can make the right actions Heinrich will talk a little bit about how do we enable these things?
00:18:06 [W] Inside our framework, but it's very important to mention that that that even though we have to extend here.
00:18:13 [W] What is available in the landscape?
00:18:20 [W] It's important to have the interface is going up from this CMP MFM functions.
00:18:22 [W] Those are industry standard.
00:18:26 [W] Have any kubernative of course because the software here in in the in the cncf landscape Works mostly on any kubernetes and Our intention is to not to create a tie-in between the framework and the kubernative distributions.
00:18:40 [W] Should be freely selectable by the Telecom operator. And of course underneath any hardware can leave.
00:18:47 [W] On top of it is the management system the open network automation platform provides us the industry standard for the interfaces here for the CMP MFM, but it it provides us much much more than that just
00:19:02 [W] Provides us a technology source to build our Management systems. And of course, we do many contributions back to your nap to make sure that that sort of the progress in lockstep with the open source community.
00:19:17 [W] It gives us a reference architecture which makes sure that whatever management system we create will be compatible with any extensions others might be doing in this space interfaces are more.
00:19:30 [W] There's a super important when it comes to the CM the p.m.
00:19:35 [W] And the FM because these ensures that any applications that we create using the application development framework will work with a third party with us. As long as that third party was also follows the owner project. And of course is a standardized.
00:19:48 [W] It gives us a reference architecture which makes sure that whatever management system we create will be compatible with any extensions others might be doing in this space interfaces are more.
00:19:49 [W] There is a super important when it comes to the CM the p.m.
00:19:50 [W] And the FM because these ensures that any applications that we create using the application development framework will work with a third party who was just as long as that third party was also follows the owner project. And of course it is
00:19:54 [W] a standardized automation platform for making sure that all the lifecycle management tasks that we need to do with our Cloud native applications can be done efficiently.
00:20:02 [W] So this is how basically the cncf itself and the landscape and the software itself gives us the modularity towards the cloud infrastructure. But also the owner projects
00:20:10 [W] Form for making sure that all the lifecycle management tasks that we need to do with our Cloud native applications can be done efficiently.
00:20:12 [W] So this is how basically the cncf itself and the landscape and the software itself gives us the modularity towards the cloud infrastructure. But also the owner projects
00:20:12 [W] on the Northbound interface for the management interfaces then I let Hendrick to go a little bit into detail of what are the additional complexities and and how do we make sure that we sort of
00:20:27 [W] Wouldnít requirements using the right level of abstraction. So as time as already mentioned, my name is Heinrich Zimmer the person and I'll give you a little more details into the complexity and abstraction that we need to address within the Telecom
00:20:42 [W] in such so the first one if we look into what we really provide like any other Telecom vendors is that we develop a network functions or an NF which is also called which is typically
00:20:57 [W] So that's that's software.
00:20:59 [W] We really developed but what really happens after that is that we hand that over to the Telecom operators that operate these Network functions.
00:21:10 [W] So there's a clear software hand over here.
00:21:17 [W] Not even talking about different organizations that really completely different companies that develop and operate this.
00:21:21 [W] So that's of course creates a completely different challenge in the whole devops flow as such and
00:21:26 [W] and that needs to be breached in some way if we look at into one specific Network function, then it can typically be up to different a hundred different microservices types and that it's really exist or creates a network function as such.
00:21:41 [W] Go to the next level looking at more like a network Telecom Network as such it contains several different networking functions.
00:21:52 [W] And of course many instances of each Network functions within that Network is such if you look at what already existed before we went going Cloud native and even 5G there is an organization
00:22:06 [W] That is just analyzing the Telecom domain.
00:22:13 [W] So there exists a lot of different standards already.
00:22:22 [W] And of course those still needs to be fulfilled and and customers are expecting that they are still fulfilled going forward the same organization.
00:22:27 [W] Of course also standardizing how to do the five yet such then that's how much over mention we have own app that creates expectation on how the different cncf should be managed.
00:22:36 [W] T' and that comes in different areas one area is configuration management.
00:22:51 [W] So by using net comfy Aang, but also how different data is exposed towards the management system. So this of course this data is can be Performance Management data fault management data or
00:22:57 [W] And if you read and look at then an extra function with this up to maybe a hundred Mike different microservices types, it can easily become extremely complex and costly to configure manage them on individual microservices level.
00:23:14 [W] It's also a lot of internal architecture focus and details on how you need to configure these kind of things and then keep in mind that the one who actually operates didn't develop them.
00:23:29 [W] So they typically don't have that kind of maybe deep knowledge into the architecture such.
00:23:41 [W] So what really the operator is looking for is a focus on how to manage configure different admin functions that they bought or want to actually run as part of the network.
00:23:44 [W] So an aggregated view from the natural function point of view really helps to abstract this and give a meaning to to the operator that Rio need to operate the network functions. Then of course looking looking into the cloud native
00:24:00 [W] We see of course that there's adds a lot of value in the kind of observability capabilities that is created within that type of system.
00:24:11 [W] But of course, we don't see that this existing 3gpp standards.
00:24:15 [W] We just go away and this transformation would happen overnight.
00:24:18 [W] So we really see that existing standards and the cloud native de facto standards that are happening right now.
00:24:27 [W] We'll have to will coexist for a long time. So this is really kind of the last
00:24:30 [W] Escape that we need to be able to operate in and provide value both to our existing customers that you know still are maybe in them not fully going cloudevents.
00:24:44 [W] So still more relying on existing standards that awful. Also, of course be able to provide all the kind of needed and we see that the value that cloud native can bring and to give some two examples in this I will
00:24:56 [W] For mismanagement where we see that we would use one same core but allow it to be exposed in different ways. And and this one core is really Prometheus that we use as the core infrastructure to provide the
00:25:12 [W] mismanagement so like in any Cloud native application Prometheus is continuous is great being metrics from the different microservices that belongs into that Network function and then of course
00:25:27 [W] Pending on the different needs we have we can expose these metrics in different ways.
00:25:38 [W] And what we how we do that is typically by developing different individual individual exposure Services as we call them and these Services typically are consuming provided apis from
00:25:48 [W] And then providing an external data format that is needed for the different type of Standards. We need to do to align to so for example in the owner case. There is a vs exposure service going back a little bit further.
00:26:02 [W] 3gpp has already defined a standard since long time ago when it comes to Performance Management and XML format of those files needs to have so that's another service and and we can expose the data complying to that
00:26:18 [W] But then of course at the same time, we want to be able to provide it more into pure Cloud native approach as well.
00:26:32 [W] So it's still possible to actually use Griffon or similar tools to consume the metric directly from Prometheus.
00:26:41 [W] And so this is a good example where we really try to breach the existing standards, but also at the same time we see how we can get the value from what really cloud native provides as such and this also enables us to
00:26:48 [W] Your friend scope of the metric consumption.
00:26:57 [W] We typically maybe own app and 3gpp has also the view of a bigger Network Telecom Network view as such whereas a griffon also allows us to really drill down into meet individual microservices
00:27:07 [W] Whereas a griffon also allows us to really drill down into meet individual microservices to really understand how they're performing or or if we can you know, if there's any kind of performance or income errors that
00:27:16 [W] If any kind of performance or become terrorists that we need to address in some way for the queen to that the lender the second area configuration management where we also done try to breach this kind of
00:27:27 [W] Configuration management.
00:27:27 [W] We're also then try to to breach this kind of different more clear knative and and the standard and expectation from from the Telecom domain as such.
00:27:38 [W] So what we've done in this area is to really clear a secure separation between the internal and external configuration model.
00:27:46 [W] Whereas the internal model really focus on the microservices point of view what that microservices providing and and Confirmation make sense from from that point of view.
00:27:51 [W] Whereas you can see the external model is more driven from potentially different standards.
00:27:58 [W] Yang and these kind of things and typically net confía en is what's expected from own open another existing Telecom Management Systems, I would say and then at the same time we have done a decentralized approach.
00:28:12 [W] To allow this kind of internal configuration to be a simple as possible for the individual microservices and and really allow the microservices to own its own configuration.
00:28:28 [W] So as you can see in the picture depending on the need it might be as simple as some Helm parameters when you're deploying that service that is the way to configure it or little bit more complex maybe going for a conflict
00:28:39 [W] When you're deploying that service that is the way to configure it or little bit more complex maybe going for a conflict map or are similar, but we also see that there are some cases where those maybe are not enough so
00:28:46 [W] See that there are some cases where those maybe are not enough.
00:28:50 [W] So really microservices brings in its own configuration database to be able to handle maybe a different type of configuration and maybe also the amount to configuration it needs to handle as such.
00:28:57 [W] But what's really read needed at the end from from a telecom point of view.
00:29:03 [W] is this kind of system aggregated configuration point and that's really what the net comfy Aang exposure can bring you so that and of course when you need to configure one at the function that really brings different Services together, and that's
00:29:18 [W] the API or the configuration model there is is more Centric around the net for function resource model to compare to my the the individual microservices resource model of such and you many cases this could also
00:29:34 [W] to configure a network function you have to of course configure magnitude of different microservices internally and we just really then I handled by this exposure service here and it could also in some cases in need
00:29:51 [W] Have to push the same configuration to several of different microservices because they have the same need but once again to allow the microservices to individually owned their configuration.
00:30:04 [W] This is handled by the the net conf.
00:30:08 [W] So the exposure service so it's really push down to the individuals microservices. So to sum up what we see is that there is tremendous value in the whole cncf X system, even for Telecom, and of course, that's
00:30:19 [W] Make sure that we can make use of and then reaching this different standards at the end. Then at the same time. Also, bring the whole Cloud native and capabilities into our customers and what
00:30:35 [W] Within Erickson is to build this moderate pulse or or framework as we would like to call it that can really bring value to 5 G and and of course also to all other applications or network functions that we are also moving
00:30:52 [W] Cloud native and such
00:30:54 [W] as you saw mean the management complexities it is it's extreme. But here we see that owner is really helping to drive Simplicity and Alignment as such.
00:31:04 [W] But we also see that open source helps to stand lies, you know creating this de facto interfaces that enables this modularity and as you can see in the in the examples, I don't have answers to to express support existing.
00:31:20 [W] And you need with this kind of independent different exposure services.
00:31:26 [W] So with that I'd like to thank everyone for listening.
00:31:34 [W] That's all for us.
00:31:34 [W] And hello again, and now we will live and we are trying to answer your questions.
00:31:47 [W] So in advance, I apologize for mispronouncing any of your names.
00:31:51 [W] Let's take them one by one.
00:31:51 [W] shall we week?
00:31:53 [W] Yeah, so I won't question was from Vijay.
00:31:58 [W] Yep.
00:32:00 [W] So what low question from Vijay come asked was could you specify which database is used for of recessions to our for Telecom call control applications think we use all sorts of different databases depending on the characteristics
00:32:13 [W] Is depending on the characteristics needs we use Cassandra views about geode I think for the core control if I remember right?
00:32:24 [W] It's a very disgusted that we are using it's important to mention that all of the databases that we have and that we use the run them on kubernative 's and then we livestock you manage them using kubernative operators.
00:32:37 [W] Sort of took the complicated path and we made sure that we can have the state also running on kubernative as well.
00:32:48 [W] So hope that was a clarification handed you want to take the next one may be sure.
00:32:53 [W] I can take the next one.
00:32:54 [W] So and that was to give a little bit of a feedback on the integration of opentelemetry with own up interfaces.
00:33:04 [W] I'm not on top of the latest discussion in all of them where they are today. But I mean, of course own up started before even you can say that the big cloud native thing happened with in Telecom, but I know of course there's a lot of
00:33:20 [W] Also, then make sure that own up can consume these interfaces for the CNF set.
00:33:28 [W] They want to to manage.
00:33:30 [W] That's that's how much I know what to expect exactly where there are in this journey.
00:33:37 [W] I don't know that deep into that project right now. So
00:33:38 [W] Hope that was some clarification at least.
00:33:42 [W] And then the last question the third question is also from Nathan HS again apologies. If that's not how you pronounce your name. The question was about Telco I guess nfv and
00:34:00 [W] We make sure that while we still have virtualized workloads on openstack and VMware that we run also the cloud native workloads as well.
00:34:14 [W] So I think we do a lot of efforts in standardization in Nats e + FV and mono to make sure that that we have the right construct and and the right way to be able to run virtualized workloads
00:34:25 [W] Enough V and model to make sure that that we have the right constructs and and the right way to be able to run virtualized workloads in a telecom Network and at the same time have parts of that the cloud where we have
00:34:31 [W] Look and at the same time have parts of that the cloud where we have kubernative sell their We Run The Cloud native Network functions.
00:34:41 [W] The biggest challenge I think is is when it comes to the different networking use cases some of the networking use cases for Telecom or what a tradition of of Telco like weepy and separation is much much easier
00:34:50 [W] Using infrastructure-as-a-service done containers a service and kubernative.
00:34:58 [W] So we are very heavily working and looking at Network servicemeshcon enable those use cases and make sure that we have the right interactions then as I see we got some more questions so that
00:35:11 [W] Next one.
00:35:20 [W] How about racing packets for each Network functions packet capture question mark for from upper bar, Samantha Heinrich, maybe you can take this one.
00:35:26 [W] Yeah, so I think that that's a little bit.
00:35:27 [W] Yes.
00:35:29 [W] So we are actually using servicemeshcon of the solutions where it actually allows to you.
00:35:33 [W] It's use it I would say currently there is a me.
00:35:38 [W] There is a latest a penalty there. So so that's why they made their nothing applying a
00:35:41 [W] servicemeshcon
00:36:00 [W] but I would say the general direction there is to actually give a using that servicemeshcon impossible and I think there is also maybe actually you already answered that question Thomas, but I was another question may be done if we are looking into
00:36:17 [W] Servicemeshcon land so that worked with Matthias and yes, we are.
00:36:28 [W] I think they're receiving us some presentation yesterday from some of our colleagues showing how we are looking into the network servicemeshcon.
00:36:47 [W] We have so we are actively contributing and and making yeah to get the network servicemeshcon to that status so we can actually more deeply integrate that into our Solutions.
00:37:01 [W] Yeah, I think it's important to state that that's right.
00:37:07 [W] Now what we have for Network servicemeshcon.
00:37:31 [W] And of course the who communities contributions, right and as Hendricks said there is a there is a presentation from Rossini ratnam and on - Ronson in the networking track that you can
00:37:46 [W] Demand, so I highly recommend you to check that out around the high V is asking what is the main benefit you see moving from vnf to see an F.
00:37:59 [W] Well, it's it's of course the word is moving ahead and obviously many benefits with Cloud native if I can just you know, bring up two of those benefits one benefit is is the actual possibility to have
00:38:16 [W] Real-time online integration of software and that just makes R&D so much faster that it is alone makes it worth to go that way.
00:38:32 [W] And of course the other reason is the tremendous value in the cncf landscape, its it would be sort of foolish to not use that to our own advantage and to our customers Advantage. So those are the main two reasons.
00:38:44 [W] Okay, so I think the real answered motives is question or network servicemeshcon.
00:38:54 [W] There is there is a new one from knitting HS. Do you want to take that Henrik?
00:38:59 [W] Yep.
00:39:00 [W] Sure.
00:39:05 [W] So the question is if they're there is a white paper mentioned about the phosphine fireworks on in the presentation and if it's still done actually available publicly, and yes it is.
00:39:14 [W] I don't know how we can include a link in somewhere here, but it should be possible to find from marik's on.com.
00:39:21 [W] I know.
00:39:23 [W] Otherwise, what we can do is we can search for it and and then maybe include the link in the slack channel so that you can get yesterday, but it was this.
00:39:38 [W] I'm not sure where the output of these is written on says I going but on the slack it will stay there and then you'll be able to access.
00:39:41 [W] post that link in the selection home
00:39:46 [W] All right. So it looks like we have run out of questions have them to be yeah one from run new video questions one from Pavel money in of so you use
00:40:06 [W] We'll have 4 cm and FM so I got lost in life. You need to re-watch.
00:40:11 [W] Yes.
00:40:13 [W] I've been basically we use owner for two things.
00:40:20 [W] We use own app for its architecture and building blocks to create our sort of Next Generation who assess system, but we also use own up to have, you know for the definition of the interfaces for the CM and FM
00:40:29 [W] And p.m.
00:40:31 [W] So those are the two main reasons, but I think if people are not familiar with own about me there as you say there are two aspects to me one is actually how to architecture and and that management system
00:40:45 [W] Out then of course, it also defines a number of interfaces for someone has developed this management system cording to own up and what are the interfaces that a CNF to then provide so it can be managed by an owner
00:41:00 [W] Man system there because they own a pass two of those aspects.
00:41:05 [W] So we get the indication from the crew here that we have 30 seconds left.
00:41:17 [W] I would highly recommend you to head over to the slack Channel and then we can continue the discussion that we really thank you for your attention and I hope to see you on this lecture now, and if you have any questions, you can find us on slack and then we can put the private
00:41:28 [W] So if you want, yep, it's wrong.
00:41:32 [W] Thank you very much. The enjoy cute con.
